**--EPISODE 1: STRONGHOLD FOX**
  [[EP1 Production]]
  [[Outline]]
  
  **Introduces Rossgivo, what Krushers are, the purpose of Strongholds, references the Fall of Chinelo, and how people have adapted to living in Stronghold Fox for the past 5 years without any contact from the outside world.**
  
  The episode opens with the setting of desolate, almost post-apocalyptic ruins of a large city with Netherlands-style architecture, which lacks any signs of normal life and appears to have been abandoned for years, as the setting sun creates a reddish evening sky.
  
  Somewhere in the city's western outskirts, in an alleyway located diagonally across a standard but narrow two-lane street, from a pedestrian-only street lined with storefronts and remnants of a small partially setup festival, is what initially appears to be a group of 6 wandering survivors, _Survey & Scavenging Team 1_, or SST 1 whose currently partaking on their _18th Expedition_ out from Stronghold Fox in an attempt to reach the supposed _New Frontlines_.
  
  5 years prior in the early hours of _January 2nd, 2065_, the initial 'frontlines'—Inland boundaries of the relatively large _Krusher (GCO) Exclusion Zone_ in Northeastern Rossgivo, lined with trenches designed to trap wandering Krushers, and were constantly patrolled by military personnel—had been suddenly and explicitly breached by Krushers near the city of Chinelo, where Stronghold Fox is located, and is the place that 5,000 civilians and about a hundred military personnel from _Division 40 of the Rossgivo Military_ took shelter in.
  
  Chinelo served as an important logistical hub for Rossgivo's railway network, but also as a sort of military base since the proximity of the GCO Exclusion Zone imposed certain restrictions on the civilian population, particularly the restriction of "_No Permanent Civilian Residences within 20km of a segment of the GCO Exclusion Zone perimeter boundary_", which had only applied to the Northern outskirts of Chinelo, and so the cleared out civilian residences were repurposed to house military personnel.
  
  
  They're led by _Ruiz Kurnell_, a 24 year old Caucasian man with short brown hair, whose wearing a grey camo military uniform with triangular insignias labeled "_40_", and a multi-bladed weapon on a large leather base which is strapped to his right forearm, referred to as "_Arm Blades_".
  
  A couple posters hung just outside the pedestrian street explains that the festival would've been a celebration of the 1000 year anniversary of "_Rossgivo_", a fictional European nation similar in size and location to the Holy Roman Empire which had existed since 1065, and has a long history of militaristic achievements and victories.
  
  Before making his way to the pedestrian street, Ruiz carefully peeks out and looks both ways down the standard but narrow street between it and the alleyway _(which only has a couple but very dusty vehicles with flat tires parked along the length of it)_, and although it wouldn't yet be noteworthy, Ruiz points out its lack of obvious structural damage that "_those things_" would typically cause, possibly because the surrounding city was likely already mostly _evacuated_.
  
  
  
  Although the festival was likely just for the local nearby residents as mentioned by one of SST 1's members, it seemed to be quite elaborate given the large number of tables, even if many of them were certainly left empty amidst a sudden evacuation of the city which was ordered for the local region near Chinelo when the frontlines were breached 5 years prior almost at the start of 2065, on January 2nd - The day after Rossgivo's anniversary.
  
  
  
  But Ruiz lacks any other military equipment, his uniform is battered with visible repair work done through additional stitching, and his overall behavior and treatment from the others indicates he's in the same predicament as the rest of the group.
  
  
  
  Ruiz's speculation is then supported after the group quickly sprints into the pedestrian street, where the partially setup festival and lack of Krusher Damage creates a strange sense of normalcy with its lack of disorder, like it was frozen in time back at the start of 2065.
  
  Ruiz walks over and tries to open the front door of a small family store, with what appears to be an apartment on its 2nd floor, but finds it to be locked, so Ruiz uses his Arm Blades to break the front door's window to open it from the inside.
  
  _SHOT: ARM BLADES_
   Ruiz's Arm Blades consist of 6 rows of interlacing triangular blades, on a large leather base strapped around Ruiz's right forearm by 2 belt-like straps just below the wrist and elbow.
   
   The wrist strap has a small handle that retracts or detracts the blades when it's pulled or pushed back, done by 2 thin strips of white rope tied to the handle which are passed through each row of blades which will force the blades into vertical positions, or pull them back down (for the rows that retract _away from the handle_, the ropes loop back around and pass through them, so it's still done by a single action.)
   
   It's shown how the Arm Blades work when Ruiz retracts the blades outward by pulling out the small handle in the wrist strap, causing the 2 thin strips of rope to be pulled towards it with a faint but noticeable dragging sound as it forces each row of blades into vertical positions one by one _(though Ruiz pulls the handle rather quickly with a sense of urgency, so its interaction with the blades is difficult to notice, however we get a couple close-ups of the Arm Blades that make it more clear without making the weapon feel slow, or that Ruiz is trying to show it off to us or something.)_
   
   Ruiz uses the tips of the blades to break the front door's window, then pushes the handle back into the wrist strap, which _mostly_ pull the blades back down, but Ruiz has to manually push down on the first row so they all interlace together properly without jutting out _(showing the weapon isn't perfectly designed, and that each row of blades can influence the others in some way.)_
   
   Ruiz reaches through the door's broken window and pulls it open using its indoor handle, which (temporary) unlocks the door after he's initially unable to do so but had triggered a mechanism in the door's lock that unlocked it on his 2nd attempt _(which is apparently common enough that Ruiz tells the door to "Open" after his 1st attempt in a sarcastic but slightly annoyed tone.)_
   
   The ropes pass through small holes on the ends of each row, followed by knots that are too big for it to fit through so it cannot be pulled out, which will force the blades into vertical positions; Another mechanism pulls them back down when the handle is pushed back, which also serves to 'reset' the ropes so that the blades can be retracted again later. 
   
   The ropes are mostly obscured inside the leather base, only visible when it pokes out above it and passes through each row before going back inside the base afterwards, almost like stiches.
  
  Once Ruiz enters the store, the rest of the group follows after him.
  
  The strange sense of normalcy continues as they refill their supplies at the store, which has gone untouched with its fully stocked organized shelfs showing no signs of looting, as if that store was merely closed for the day.
  
  _Everett_, a man with medium brown skin whose carrying a large handheld lantern, enters the store after Ruiz and uses his lantern to illuminate a pitch dark aisle in a blueish light, allowing the rest of the group to quickly begin looting for supplies.
  
  SST 1 is shown to be an experienced, coordinated team as they locate and strategically loot certain nutritious canned and non-perishable food, taking into account the number of calories, nutritional value, and compact size compared to other food products—Especially with the help of Dave, who has memorized the details of common food products to the point that he's able to pick out specific products, and thus does most of the work.
  
  SST 1 also restocks on any important and/or useful survival supplies that they've depleted.
  
  _SCENE: STORE_
   Despite the apocalyptic setting, the store's interior looks untouched _(albeit it's full of dust, and there's large waist-level baskets by the storefront windows reeking with the smell of rotten produce.)_
  
   The store only has two lines of double-sided shelfs, and 3 freezers at the back that limit them to diary products and a couple freezable/microwavable foods, which have already long expired due to the complete lack of refrigeration for several years.
  
   There's a dozen handheld red shopping baskets stacked up near the entrance, a single checkout across from the entrance behind a white marble-topped wooden counter, with about 32 square metres of open space between them, and small shelfs along the adjacent wall stocked with usual last-minute shopping items such as candy, gum, birthday/anniversary cards, and magazines that seem to cover a generic wide range of topics _(however their covers are unreadable since they use **Rossgivian**, a fictional writing system that resembles Kanji, but uses its own symbols.)_
  
   Everything is spaced apart just enough to avoid being too claustrophobic _(2m spacing; 3m for the aisle between the shelfs)_, and there's open space between the entrance and checkout to allow for a freedom of movement and help avoid potential clogs of people blocking each other from moving past.
  
   The only light in the store comes from the already limited sunlight streaming in through its large storefront windows, which mostly gets blocked by the first line of shelfs, still leaving most of the store in complete darkness.
   
   Ruiz attempts to prop the front door open using the nearby stack of shopping baskets that he topples over, but kicks them aside after quickly realising the door can easily shove them when it tries to close as soon as Ruiz briefly stops holding it open, but gives up on it since the rest of SST 1 had entered the store by that point.
   
   Cale asks Ruiz if the door was left unlocked, since he knows Ruiz has a lockpicking kit but clearly hadn't used it on the door, and Cale isn't sure if opening a locked door using the handle in the room it locks off is supposed to unlock it. Ruiz replies, saying it was likely meant to let anyone locked inside the store to leave, since it'll automatically lock itself after the door closes.
   
   Cale walks over to the dark store aisle, and turns on the large high-illumination lantern he's been carrying, illuminating it in a bright blueish-white light that easily reaches the other end of the store without much light falloff, due to Cale having accidently set it to its max brightness at an earlier point.
  
   The lantern's brightness is so intense that any nearby products on the shelfs with light-coloured labeling are almost unreadable until Cale quickly lowers its brightness.
   
   After Cale lowers the lantern's brightness to a lower manageable level that still decently lights up the aisle, we see what's on the store shelfs: The shelfs are fully and neatly stocked with a variety of products, their lack of disorder and missing items indicates there's been no looting, despite first-time expectations of the store shelfs being looted bare considering the apocalyptic setting, so besides the rotting produce and very dusty interior, it's almost as if the store was merely closed for the day.
   
   The products are normal and commonplace, such as canned food, silverware, beverages, batteries, school supplies, and toilet paper. The most notable products are at the ends of the shelfs near the entrance, with a section of small fireworks and sparklers dedicated to the nation's 1000 year anniversary, which likely occurred just before the society fell since taking advantage of such an occasion would probably only last a couple weeks.
   
   Right away, SST 1 begins searching through the shelfs, taking note of what they find, passing it onto others, and loot food with high nutrition and calories, and any supplies useful in survival such as batteries. There's a clear sense of coordination, familiarity, and experience among them.
  
   We get a good look at Ruiz: He's white, has short brown hair, his Arm Blades are rows of blades on a leather base strapped around his right forearm, he's wearing a large hiking backpack full of supplies and equipment, and a grey camo military uniform with triangular insignias labeled "40" on the shoulders _(He also has 2 smoke grenades in the right side pocket of his hiking backpack, with 6 more stored inside it.)_
  
   Everyone else wears a mix of casual long-sleeved shirts, closed-toe shoes/boots, and they also have hiking backpacks full with supplies like Ruiz _(albeit a bit less since they refill their supplies at the store, otherwise the scene wouldn't make sense.)_
   
   As SST 1 refills their supplies, Ruiz makes a remark about how the store hadn't been touched since 2065...
   
   Ruiz tells Cale to look in the back of the store for a storage room to see if there were any additional supplies that weren't stocked on the shelfs, after he noticed the shelfs were fully stocked that had reminded Ruiz of the possibility of there being a storage room, and the fact some product space was used for the nation's 1000th anniversary could mean there were still other products left in storage.
   
   Cale passes the lantern over to Ruiz so he can take his place in lighting up the store aisle, then grabs a flashlight that's being held onto his specialized belt to light the way as he moves into the back of the store.
   
   since Cale wasn't knowledgeable enough about the local products and their nutritional value to loot food nearly as efficiently as the rest of SST 1 _(that's why he was manning the lantern)_
  
  Ruiz tells Cale to look for a storage room in the back to see if there were additional supplies not stocked on the shelfs, so Cale passes his lantern over to Ruiz so they can light up the store aisle in his place, before moving to the back of the store with a smaller traditional flashlight.
  
  Cale comes across the staffroom, which has skylights that let enough sunlight in for Cale to quickly look around without the flashlight, but as he sets down his hiking backpack by a nearby table, a 5 year old Calendar mounted on the wall across from him catches Cale's attention, as it was last marked off on _January 1st (Thursday), 2065_, the day before (Chinelo) fell 5 years prior.
  
  Out of habit from his time in SST 3 _(led by Gavis who's much more laidback than Ruiz)_ which he only recently transferred from into SST 1 before the expedition, Cale calls Ruiz over to check out (the Calendar - Cale doesn't specify this), before realising it was unnecessary to do so and opts to instead explain himself to Ruiz.
  
  Ruiz then enters the staffroom, presumably having passed the lantern to another member since he clearly doesn't have the large conspicuous lantern on him, and he also took a bit longer than Cale to walk over to the staffroom just a couple metres away, which Ruiz himself points out later.
  
  Cale admits to calling Ruiz over because of the Calendar, and tries to play it off as briefly causing his task of finding the storage room slip his mind. However, Ruiz then asks if Cale he found the storage room, forcing Cale to tell Ruiz he hasn't _(quickly adding on "yet" soon after.)_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _SCENE: MOURNING_
   Ruiz is standing beside the grave of _Everett_, a support role member in SST 1 who died to a Krusher during the previous (18th) expedition a few days prior.
   
   Everett's body had to be left behind with his grave serving as a memorial rather than having a practical purpose, as is indicated by its surrounding untouched soil _(but this isn't a unique detail as it's the case for a couple other graves.)_
   
   The grave is located in a small but organized cemetery, with 14 other graves neatly arranged in what would be rows of 10 with no room for more due to the surrounding buildings, and the fact the cemetery used to be a small park but became a small secluded area in one of the corners along Stronghold Fox's west perimeter _Krusher Walls_ - 5.5m tall segmented concrete walls reinforced with steel beams, designed to endure the heaviest blows from Krushers.
   
   Ruiz wears casual but non-vibrant clothing: A grey coat over a white T-shirt, and black pants, with a somber look of regret as he stares ahead at Everett's grave, the only noise being the rustling of nearby trees in the wind.
   
   The silence is broken by an older man with brown skin, _Marcus Devan_, who enters the cemetery through a creaking metal gate that announces his presence - wanting to check up on Ruiz as he's worried about his mental state since Ruiz had witnessed Everett die in a gruesome manner.
   
   From what Marcus knows, the lower half of Everett's body had been crushed by a Krusher after it was unexpectedly agitated by a loose object blowing in the wind behind Everett, which although Everett had likely quickly succumbed to, there could've been a brief window of time for Everett to scream out in agony, something Ruiz might feel guilty for as he's the Leader of SST 1 but failed to save Everett in time.
   
   Marcus hides the fact that he fought in the _Millow Civil War_ for the resistance, during which he saw similar gruesome sights, and so was adamant about talking to Ruiz because of his similar trauma to what Ruiz could be experiencing, though Marcus played it off as being because of his higher maturity and life experience since he's 22 years older than Ruiz.
   
   Marcus attempts to soothe Ruiz, reminding him that they were in uncharted territory as the 18th expedition was the furthest SST 1 had currently managed to travel out from Stronghold Fox, and that Everett was a victim of unlucky circumstances that were outside of anyone's control, regardless of if Ruiz's team entirely consists of former military personnel specially trained to handle Krushers.
   
   The main reason Marcus is the Leader of SST 2 despite his great physicality and high endurance which would be well suited for the expeditions, is because he's seen as a civilian who got stranded inside the Stronghold, while Division 40 of the Rossgivo Military was stationed in the region with the purpose of defending Rossgivo from the threat of Krushers, and as such were already trained to handle them.
   
   In response, Marcus tells Ruiz not to consider himself responsible for Everett's death, and that Ruiz should step back from his leadership role of the SSTs for the time being to focus on his mental health while Marcus fills in for him, until Ruiz is prepared to take on another expedition to ensure that Everett's death wouldn't be for nothing.
  
  
  
  In the early morning of March 1st, 2070 with the weather having visibly low wind, SST 1 sets out from Stronghold Fox on their 19th Expedition.
  
  _Survey & Scavenging Team 1_, a group of 6 wearing hiking backpacks compacted with equipment and food rations, long sleeved shirts and jackets, heavy-duty shoes and boots - led by Ruiz whose wearing a grey camo military uniform with large triangular insignias labeled "_40_" and has the nametag "_Pvt. Kurnell_", with a multi-bladed weapon on a large leather base strapped to his right forearm.
  
  SST 1 sprints across several wide open streets of an abandoned Netherlands-style city in ruin, carefully making their way from alleyway to alleyway while looking out for something, but with a sense of direction as they follow visible landmarks, many of which appear to have been set up at some point for that purpose, such as coloured pieces of cloth tied up high to utility poles.
  
  Except for Cale, who has to be tugged along in the right direction a couple of times, being the least experienced of the group, as is evident when SST 1 goes into a seemingly random building which Cale questions, but serves as a shortcut to reach a skywalk over a wide road.
  
  Each of the 6 members appearances' indicates their character and role: Ruiz still wears his _military uniform_ from Division 40, giving him a more authoritative appearance as the Leader, alongside his _Arm Blades_, a multi-bladed weapon strapped around his right forearm.
  
  Dave wears glasses as he's nearsighted, giving him a more intelligent appearance as the Drone Operator, a segmented civilian drone stored in a relatively small black plastic case hooked onto the left side of his hiking backpack.
  
  Amy wears a red cross armband on her left upper arm as she's the Field Medic, and stores extra medical supplies and equipment in a utility belt around her waist.
  
  Frank has spiky reddish hair and a large muscular body, being the most physically strong of SST 1 paired with high endurance, who carries bulky equipment and additional supplies.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  SST 1 hurriedly moves down a section of a decaying highway strewn with wrecked military vehicles, and even a Tank which had its turret warped inward, along with destroyed sandbags, which Frank - a tall muscular man with spiky reddish hair - notes as most likely being the ruins of an attempted blockade _set up during the Fall of Chinelo_ (not directly stated as such), something SST 1 occasionally comes across during their expeditions.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The evening sky has a slight reddish hue as SST 1 continues moving down the highway towards the northern outskirts of an abandoned city in ruin, presumably being the result of whatever apocalyptic event had occurred, where SST 1 plans to stay the night.
  
  The blockade, although long since destroyed, seemed to have been forcibly pushed through by a large mass of sorts, and appeared to have been hastily put together, as noted by Nathan as they pass by it, consisting of sand bags that _apparently_ couldn't have held up on their own as is visibly clear, but there isn't any other noticeable debris that might've possibly reinforced the blockade besides the vehicles themselves, and the Tank was understandable positioned in such a way that'd hold off "_Krushers_", but strangely there wasn't any nearby Krusher remains that the Tank could've killed, nor is it clear how exactly the Tank was damaged in such a peculiar way.
  
  The wrecked military vehicles were severely damaged, warped inwards, and pushed off to the sides of the highway, but the Tank appeared to have stayed in place because of its sheer weight, however its main gun was completely detached and appeared to have crumbled into pieces, and the front of its turret was visibly warped inward, with comparatively moderate damage to its front and side armor.
  
  Regardless, Ruiz pushes SST 1 forward as there's not much time left before sundown, being a more pressing issue than the Tank's unusual damage.
  
  
  SST 1 moves past all the wreckage and reaches a fairly impressive city welcome sign soon after, even with its clear signs of weathering damage from the lack of upkeep.
  
  _Everett_, the support member of SST 1 - with medium brown skin and short black hair - proudly announces that they've made it 45km out from the "_Stronghold_", which is the furthest distance that any of the "_expeditions_" had gone.
  
  Although, the distance somewhat concerns Everett as SST 1 has yet to come across definitive signs of the "_New Frontlines_" besides the occasional ruins of attempted blockades, meaning the nation's military was pushed back _at least 65km_ from the original frontlines when they were breached 5 years prior - likely even further than that considering the lack of noticeable activity that SST 1 should've noticed by then if they were nearby.
  
  Ruiz attempts to uplift Everett's spirit, pointing out that the amount of _Krusher damage_ steadily decreasing the further out they go from "_Chinelo_", and that the generally hilly terrain would _significantly slow the movement of Krushers_ as they would've narrowed down their routes to a number of highways and roads where the breach could've likely been contained - especially considering the fact that their nation, "_Rossgivo_" has had one of the most powerful and successful militaries throughout history, and has now had 20 years of innovation to combat Krushers.
  
  But for now, SST 1 has to carefully tread around the outskirts of the city as going straight through the unexplored city-centre is far too dangerous as the dense concentration of buildings creates plenty of blind spots where Krushers could be hidden, whereas the low rise outskirts which although still have blindspots and provide less supplies, is undoubtably the best option.
  
  
  However, finding a multi-story apartment building or hotel in an enclosed area, where SST 1 tends to stay during nights because of their existing living areas and protection from Krushers will be far more difficult, especially when most of the buildings in the outskirts are only two or three stories tall.
  
  Before continuing, _Dave_ takes off the small black plastic case that was hooked to the side of his hiking backpack, and opens it on the ground where he begins assembling the small _segmented civilian drone_ that was stored inside.
  
  The inside of the case has cushioning designed to perfectly fit each specific part, though the camera mount sticks out figuratively and literally, most of it being a 3D printed light grey plastic rather than the white black-striped colour scheme the rest of the drone has, and partially juts out of the cushioning.
  
  The drone's camera also juts out since it's a _non-native model_, with visibly different branding on it and the drone's main body, which the camera mount was clearly modified to fit since they both jut out to about the same height, made obvious by them being positioned next to each other.
  
  The Drone has a dedicated controller and an attachable antenna that can remotely connect to it, with a screen to see out of its camera mounted to its underside, also used for the user interface, though the antenna was meant as a backup option since the Drone is supposed to connect through Wi-Fi, as explained by a popup which Dave closes almost immediately; The controller is also at 68% charge, presumably having already been used for a while.
  
  
  Dave flies the drone high above SST 1 to about 30m, using the aerial view to check blindspots in SST 1's vicinity, which although he doesn't get an unobstructed view of it's still high enough for Dave to check for Krushers as they're too conspicuous to be completely hidden, but he still flies the drone over open areas where they're about to cross through to ensure those areas are clear.
  
  As SST 1 moves through the western outskirts of the city, they come across sparce structural damage apparently caused by Krushers which generally tracts towards the south, and most of it appeared to be caused purely by the large bodies of Krushers rather than the usual result of collateral damage, a trend SST 1 has seen as they moved further southwest from the Stronghold.
  
  Near sundown, SST 1 just about reaches the southern half of the city before they're forced to retreat into a nearby abandoned midrise apartment building for the night, the following morning, Dave goes up to the rooftop and assembles his drone, in order to look around their surroundings from high above.
  
  The drone's camera was switched for a non-native model that had higher resolution, but was lightweight and similar in design enough to use the same camera mount, just with a slight modification in 3D printed slightly off coloured grey plastic to fit it.
  
  Dave surveys their surroundings using the drone, initially focused on the general areas along their planned route through the outskirts where he spots 2 distant Krushers, but his attention drifts over to the open rural fields to the southwest, which are mostly covered in large empty brown farmland that still have some signs of tilling, though their crops have long since died with most having already wilted away.
  
  At that moment, Dave notices a long continuous line in the horizon, too thin to be a river bank though he didn't recall there being a nearby river in the general area, but Dave doesn't get his hopes up and first takes a photo of it at the furthest zoom level that the camera can go, which although he still has to greatly zoom into the photo, the fact the camera is a _non-native model_ gave it just enough resolution for Dave to at least know it wasn't anything natural, and he heavily considers the possibility of it being a _trench line built to stop Krushers_.
  
  Trenches were a necessary part of the frontlines, especially with the long length of the frontlines, which work similarly to anti-Tank ditches: Trenches were at least a metre deep and 4 metres wide, large enough to trap a Krusher and heavily hinder their movement, allowing patrolling soldiers to dispatch of any Krushers with very little risk, and ensures the safety of nearby civilian populations.
  
  Some trenches were partially built at a shallower depth but still had a section just big enough for a Krusher's body to fit which would almost immobilize Krushers, to reduce construction workload and more importantly cost.
  
  
  
  
  The entrance is on a 2-lane street closed off by two 3m wide chain-link gates, but there's a trench with wooden duckboards going over it which is dug into the street past the crossing, though it was clearly dug _after_ whatever apocalyptic event occurred in the city, which lies in complete ruin in stark contrast to the Stronghold.
  
  However, the Stronghold appears more so as a small neighborhood sectioned off from the city rather than a thought out fortification, as it doesn't seem to have any new structures that could've been built for it to suit the purpose of a Stronghold, such as a close concentration of essential facilities, as is shown by a brief flashback-like comparison of what the area originally looked like before the Fall of Chinelo, where the only significant difference besides the running trainline and busy traffic is the addition of the perimeter Krusher walls.
  
  _SST HQ_ is the closest example of changes being made for Stronghold Fox, a planned 6 floor office building that was under construction when the Exclusion Zone expanded over it in 2062, which although didn't impact its potential usage, its parent company _Greyson Industries_ was unwilling to burden their employees with the constant awareness of the nearby frontlines, and sold the site off to the Government for a relatively minimal sum that covered their expenses; Because the surrounding area was mostly residential and needed to be cleared out either way, _the area was chosen to be the site of Stronghold Fox_.
  
  The only noticeable visual difference the HQ has from the birds-eye view is the installment of solar panels on the roof, but the building's two unfinished top floors when it was sold off were redesigned so that it could better serve as a central command area for Stronghold Fox.
  
  The location of SST HQ is shown by a _Rossgivo Flag_ just outside, hanging down in the low wind, in the centre of a public park which now acts as a sort of central plaza in the Stronghold - the camera zooms out from the window, revealing that in the _chart room_ located on one of the two redesigned floors of the SST HQ.
  
  The chart room is clearly a planning room of sorts as there's a nation-wide map of "_Rossgivo_" pinned to a corkboard on the wall, and a city-wide map of "_Chinelo_" laid out across two tables arranged next to each other that'd allow people to gather around it, with shelfs full of documents spread out along the walls, and office desks around the front of the room.
  
  Printed on the Rossgivo map is a "_GCO Exclusion Zone_", a large clearly defined region in the northwest that spans 3 sub-divided territories, shaded in black stripes, with light grey stripes used in a thin 8km region from its boundaries _(except for its east boundary which goes along a mountain range on Rossgivo's Eastern Border with Millow.)_
  
  It's unclear what "_GCO_" is an acronym for, but it was apparently normalized and widespread enough to be printed on nation-wide maps of Rossgivo, and its presumably the 'thing' shown in the thumbnail if there's an exclusion zone for it _(which are most commonly called "Krushers")_
  
  Chinelo, a city partially inside the Exclusion Zone, is marked by a big yellow dot, indicating it's the location of the Stronghold, with 18 marked different coloured routes that gradually extend out further and further from it towards the southwest where the nation's capital, "_Nicole_" is located.
  
  However, the actual Exclusion Zone has most certainly expanded since Chinelo now lies in ruin, as is shown by the map's 2064 copyright, 6 years prior to the current year 2070, shown by a nearby _somewhat bland_ Calendar which someone briefly takes down from the wall to update it to March, the current day being _March 1st_ as is obvious from all the days in February being marked off.
  
  There's a large number of towns and cities near Chinelo that have been crossed off, all of which are located along at least one of the 18 marked routes, and presumably lay in complete ruin similar to Chinelo.
  
  The Chinelo's map has much more detail - the Stronghold has a defined black outline, _SST HQ_ is labeled as such, and across Chinelo are numerous connected colour-coded safe routes each with a unique name _(though they're all written in Rossgivo's kanji-like writing system.)_
  
  Several wide streets near the Stronghold have been barricaded off - going by the additional map legend in the top left corner since their symbols are drawn as rectangles - creating a 'safe zone' of about 100m _(or in Gavis's opinion, 300m if people still actively avoid Krushers since the far fewer passageways Krusher can take makes potential encounters rather predictable)_, however as Ruiz later explains during the Highway scene, those barriers can only stop wandering Krushers since their body fluids will be less condensed, making them far less destructive than agitated Krushers.
  
  Back at the Stronghold's entrance, one of the chain-link gates slide open, allowing _Scavenging & Survey Team 1 (SST 1)_ to leave on their 19th expedition in an attempt to reach the _New Frontlines_ believed to have followed the _Fall of Chinelo_.
  
  Those expeditions started 4 years prior in 2066, when the Stronghold's residents hadn't _(and still haven't)_ heard anything from the outside world, possibly due to the lack of proper equipment in the Stronghold, however the military seemingly hasn't tried using aircraft to bypass the Krushers in order to reach Stronghold Fox _at all_, which is quite worrying but most of the Stronghold's residents are still hopeful for an eventual military rescue _(however the objective of the expedition isn't brought up until later when Ruiz casually mentions that the hilly terrain in Northern Rossgivo could be a potential location for the New Frontlines.)_
  
  
  
  
  
  Cale has a young casual appearance as the newest and youngest member, but didn't receive Krusher Combat Training as he was a Communications Operator, and so takes on a support role _(he carries a large handheld high-illumination lantern.)_
  
  Besides Cale, it's very clear that SST 1 knows all the safe routes in Chinelo, managing to make their way out of the city in just under an hour, with Cale being the most inexperienced of the group as he almost takes the wrong route a couple times.
  
  As SST 1 makes their way through Chinelo, there's recognizable signs of structural damage caused by Krushers, such as large gouges matching a Krusher's profile, grazing to the corners of structures near turns/intersections, seemingly random elevated damage caused by flying debris, and especially buildings that had conspicuous outdoor moving elements which are the most heavily damaged _(as noted by Cale when they pass by the ruins of what was a popular restaurant, which is so badly damaged that Cale only locates the site because he went there frequently and remembers the general area - apparently, it was most likely caused by the purposefully loose swaying signs by its entrance, though how exactly it did so isn't mentioned.)_
  
  However, there's a couple outliers with similar amounts of significant damage, despite most likely having no moving elements, or at least conspicuous ones, such as plain office buildings in Chinelo's southern outskirts.
  
  Once SST 1 makes it out of Chinelo, there's a time skip into the evening.
  
  
  SST 1 is moving down a barren southbound highway toward a small town, "_Thurein_" as labeled by one of two collapsed overhanging signs marking an exit into it - the other sign being on a northbound highway along the southbound, separated by a ditch except at the highway exit where there's a connection road to allow for exits from the northbound - and a distance marker of 63km to _Nicole_ continuing ahead to the south, and on the northbound sign, 21km to _Chinelo_ in the north (as well as 2km to _Octaluo_), all while the setting sun casts a faint orange haze across the surrounding hilly terrain.
  
  Past the collapsed sign on the southbound, along the lane markings are _torn out strips of asphalt_, and _narrow structural concrete bases with metallic fronts_ on the edges of the highway which they align with, but those structures were mostly or entirely destroyed by "_Krushers_", and the debris is scattered around the area - the same occurred on the northbound, except for an _undamaged structure_ on its outer edge that shows the original design of the structures.
  
  The structures were 4.5m in height, similar to that of a Krusher, but their narrow width and how much they were spaced apart wouldn't have given them nearly enough surface area to hold off the heaviest impacts from a Krusher, as is obvious from the fact that all but one of them were heavily damaged or destroyed.
  
  But the highway is such a common route for the expeditions to take that only Cale, the newest (and youngest) member of SST 1, is intrigued by the highway structures.
  
  
  As SST 1 approaches the highway exit, Ruiz gradually starts jogging ahead and looks down the length of the highways, looking out for any Krushers which SST 1 haven't yet seen since they've left Chinelo early that morning - In stark contrast to the 18th expedition just 2 weeks prior which went the same route and still spotted at least 5 Krushers in their close vicinity after the first day, though that detail isn't outright mentioned until the Apartment scene _(Cale also notices the lone undamaged structure along the northbound.)_
  
  Because of the low number of Krushers, SST 1 reached the city of Octaluo a little over an hour before sundown, originally planning to stay the night since their arrival is normally delayed by Krushers, but with the extra time they had, the other members convinced Ruiz to press on and continue towards the nearby town of Thurein.
  
  Thurein hadn't yet been surveyed as it was a small town of 3000 that offered very little supplies, and was isolated by the hilly terrain with only two highway connections in and out, both along that same highway a few hundred metres apart, and a complex series of old dirt trails of roads that wouldn't provide enough of a shortcut to be worth taking.
  
  Though rather than wanting to make a bit more progress before sundown, most of SST 1 wanted the chance to grab _commercial food products_ which had become a luxury in Stronghold Fox since they were hardly stockpiled, however Ruiz was _reasonably_ almost never willing to put SST 1 in potential danger solely for that reason unless it was absolutely safe for them to do so, though it'd have to stay under a 1 kg weight limit since Ruiz would still consider them nonessential items unless it was to resupply their food rations.
  
  Considering how isolated Thurein was, and that Cale himself knew it was evacuated long before the Krushers could've reached it, it had likely gone _untouched by Krushers_ for the past 5 years, which led to the other members of SST 1 persuading Ruiz into continuing onward to Thurein.
  
  
  Besides Cale, SST 1 is aware that the highway structures were _Krusher Barriers_ designed to stop _wandering Krushers_, similar to the street barricades set up in Chinelo, with Ruiz having explained them several times during previous expeditions as their intriguing ambiguous remnants always sparked questions for each new member - largely because the barriers were installed mere days before the frontlines fell, and only people in the logistics department were informed of them through a generic mass email regarding potential delays during its construction.
  
  As Cale ponders, Ruiz tells SST 1 to stay at the intersection before quickly moving down the highway exit - before Ruiz returns to SST 1 a while later, there's a cut showing that he climbs onto one of the hills to get a better vantage point, from where he spots the observation area about 50 metres ahead, and the stretch of highway leading up to it, both clear of any Krushers _(Ruiz doesn't actually see most of the highway, but Krushers are too conspicuous to be completely hidden by the hills as he notes.)_
  
  Cale takes the chance to investigate the torn out strips of asphalt, which have fairly deep pits that he discovers are harshly damaged foundations that were partially torn out of the ground along with their structures, which along with the remnants of the other structures, means there were eight 4.5m tall barriers spanning across both highways, facing north to where the frontlines were, all perfectly aligned with each other.
  
  Their supports and height are noticeably similar to that of _Krusher Barriers_, however their width of only 30cm would've given them a low surface area that wouldn't hold off the heaviest impacts from a Krusher, especially with how spaced apart the structures were, as is obvious from the fact that all but one of them were heavily damaged or destroyed.
  
  Ruiz returns, and tells SST 1 that they _could_ enter Thurein from an observation area, which although is located atop tall cliffs, should have a winding staircase down the cliffside assuming it hasn't collapsed, though either way it'll serve as a good vantage point overlooking Thurein to spot any Krushers potentially hidden within the town.
  
  Cale takes the chance to ask Ruiz about the highway structures, suspecting that they were Krusher Barriers, but he's held up on their low surface caused by their unique design, which Cale hasn't seen before.
  
  Because Krusher Barriers were traditionally used to block off decommissioned highways located within the _Exclusion Zone_ to prevent Krushers from using them, their traditional design is: 5m tall reinforced metal barriers spanning the width of a highway, which ensure Krushers cannot break through them by forcing them to spread out their body fluids too greatly, for a Krusher to then still have enough left over to create the momentum necessary to break through the barriers.
  
  Ruiz quickly explains in a _somewhat annoyed tone_ as they move down the highway exit, that the structures are indeed Krusher Barriers, but their designs are meant to stop _wandering Krushers_, much like the street barricades near Stronghold Fox that the SSTs set up over the years, which merely consist of abandoned buses and vehicles used to block off wide streets _(interlocked to prevent Krushers from pushing through them.)_
  
  Those barricades obviously aren't on the level of the _Krusher Walls_ that surround the Stronghold, but what makes Krushers destructive is their _concentration of body fluids_ when they try to destroy a target they're agitated by, which unagitated, or more accurately wandering Krushers, only do while aimlessly moving but at a far lesser sCale, being much more spread out and stays at the bottom half of their body.
  
  As for how the highway barriers were destroyed, Ruiz casually suggests the possibility of passing rain showers agitating Krushers that were stuck behind the barriers, but doesn't expand on it _(context for this comes up during the Apartment scene, but even Cale admits that it sounds stupid, as if the rain merely weakened the barriers too greatly.)_
  
  _SCENE: Highway_
   We see the dirty muddy soles of the heavy duty boots/shoes Ruiz and the rest of SST 1 wear, as they walk down the rough cracking asphalt of a barren 3-lane southbound highway approaching an offshoot highway exit into "_Thurein_", as named by a now collapsed overhanging road sign that also shows they're 63km away from Nicole up ahead to the south, while another such sign on an identical northbound highway beside the southbound, shows that SST 1 is now 21km out from _Chinelo_, and 2km out from "_Octaluo_" where they originally planned to stay the night _(there's a number of other distance markers to a variety of towns and cities but they're labeled in Rossgivian, Rossgivo's kanji-like writing system, and aren't focused on by the depth of field)_
   
   A slow pan along Ruiz's body shows us his _Arm Blades_, the smoke grenades in the right side pocket of his hiking backpack used later in the Encounter scene, his grey camo military uniform with triangular insignias numbered "40", presumably that of Ruiz's 'Unit 40' but the fact he also left from the Stronghold and doesn't have any other traditional military equipment indicates he's merely a stray survivor; He also has somewhat messy short brown hair.
   
   The north and southbound are separated by a tall grass filled ditch, except at a connection road across from the highway exit that allowed for exits from the northbound, and they're surrounded by tall hilly terrain, while the setting sun casts a faint orange haze across the area.
   
   Cale, the newest and youngest member of SST 1, with light blondish hair, a skinny body _(and is carrying a blue handheld high-illumination lantern used later in the Store scene)_, notices small pieces of broken concrete, rebar and generally more intact but warped long pieces of metal strewn along the southbound, especially around the intersection where strips of asphalt along the weathered and off-white lane markings have been harshly torn out and scattered around the area in fairly large chunks, with the ground beneath them noticeably dug out. 
   
   But because the highway is such a common route for the expeditions to take, only Cale pays much attention to the strange debris and missing asphalt.
   
   
   As SST 1 gets closer to the intersection, Ruiz gradually starts jogging ahead and looks down the length of the highways which turn out of view a hundred metres to the south, leaning over to find an better angle as he looks out for any Krushers since SST 1 hadn't seen any since they've left Chinelo early that morning; Even when using Dave's drone which they actively use to avoid dangerous encounters with Krushers.
   
   Although Krushers have been scattering out over the past 5 years, the 18th expedition went the same route just 2 weeks prior and still spotted 5 Krushers in close vicinity on the first day, and were forced to take detours to get around them, while the ongoing 19th expedition has only spotted a single distant Krusher back in Chinelo.
   
   Because of the low number of Krushers, SST 1 reached the city of Octaluo a little over an hour before sundown, originally planning to stay the night since their arrival was normally delayed by Krushers, but since it was the first day of the expedition there wasn't any need to resupply, so the other members of SST 1 convinced Ruiz to continue onward to the small town of Thurein.
   
   However, rather than wanting to make a bit more progress, most of SST 1 wanted to grab _commercial food products_ which had become a luxury in Stronghold Fox since they were hardly stockpiled _(there's even a black market for them, which Nathan knows of but keeps to himself)_ however Ruiz is almost never willing to put SST 1 in potential danger solely for that reason unless it was absolutely safe for them to do so, but they'd have to stay under 1 kg weight limit since Ruiz would still consider the items nonessential unless it was to resupply their food rations.
   
   So with how isolated Thurein was, and the fact Cale himself knew it was evacuated long before any Krushers could've reached it, it had likely gone _untouched by Krushers_ for the past 5 years, which led to the other members persuading Ruiz into continuing onward to Thurein.
   
   
   Cale notices heavily damaged _narrow structural concrete bases with metallic fronts_ on the edges of the highways that are aligned with the missing strips of asphalt, clearly being where all the scattered debris came from, but it's ambiguous as to what the structures were until Cale spots a lone undamaged structure on the outer edge of the northbound highway.
   
   Besides minor chipping and cracking that might've been caused by flying debris when the other structures were _most likely_ torn apart by Krushers, but could've just been natural deterioration, the undamaged structure shows the original design of the other highway structures: 4.5m tall barrier-like structures, with metallic fronts facing north towards where the frontlines were.
   
   As Cale ponders over this, Ruiz tells SST 1 to stay put as he quickly moves down the highway exit and goes to climb onto one of the hills to get a better vantage point of their surroundings, while the rest of SST 1 remain idle.
   
   Frank watches Ruiz run down the highway exit for a short while, before bluntly asking the other members what were their favourite commercial food products before the frontlines fell.
   
   Cale names a random fictional food brand _(which doesn't mirror an actual brand)_ but is confused as to why Frank suddenly brought up that topic, so Frank explains that either the rest of SST 1 wanted to tire themselves out more before sundown, or that they wanted the chance to eat something else besides the food rations and wanted to get to the relatively isolated small town of Thurein before sundown so that they would have an excuse to go scavenge for food products, since Ruiz normally wouldn't let them do so unless it was absolutely safe.
   
   
   most commercial products weren't stockpiled in the Stronghold's supplies - at best they weren't allowed to have any branding to avoid the government being seen as bias towards certain companies, which Frank jokes abut
   
   
   
   Cale takes the chance to investigate the undamaged structure - the other members have noticed Cale's behaviour by now, which Nathan tries to poke fun at until Frank, who has slick red hair and a muscular body, calls him out since Nathan himself did something similar when he first passed by the area, indicating Frank is one of the oldest members of SST 1, and that Cale's curiosity isn't a unique reaction of his.
   
   Cale notes that flat-laid asphalt normally isn't ripped up by Krushers, so he checks one of the strips and discovers that they have fairly deep pits with damaged concrete foundations at the bottom, which matches up with the other structures that have visible foundations, and since the damage to the asphalt is only slightly larger than the base of the structures, there must've been a line of 8 structures spanning across both highways, with nearby asphalt having been torn up when the middle structures were destroyed.
   
   However, even though the height of the structures is about the same as a Krusher's, Cale is unsure of if the structures were _Krusher Barriers_ because of their width, which would've given them a low surface area far too insufficient to hold up against the heaviest blows from a Krusher, especially with how spread apart they were, as is obvious from the fact all but one of them were heavily damaged or destroyed.
   
   Ruiz, who by now has returned, tells SST 1 they can move down the highway exit and branch out towards an observation area, which although is located atop tall cliffs, there should be a winding staircase they can take down into Thurein provided it hasn't collapsed from lack of maintenance, though either way the area serves as a good vantage point overlooking Thurein to spot any Krushers potentially hidden within the town.
   
   Cale takes the chance to ask Ruiz about the highway structures as they're moving down the highway exit towards the observation room.
   
   Ruiz quickly explains in a somewhat annoyed tone, clearly having explained it several times during previous expeditions, that the highway structures are indeed Krusher Barriers, but those particular barriers were designed to stop wandering Krushers, despite Krusher Barriers normally being used to block off decommissioned highways located within the Exclusion Zone.
   
   Their narrow width was done to keep the highway operational without obstructing the lanes too greatly, but should've still been able to stop Krushers, though only because wandering Krushers won't "_condense their body fluids_" into specific areas of their Krushers, which is what makes Krushers highly destructive, except while moving though it'll still be much more spread out and stay at the bottom half of their bodies.
   
   Though the barriers clearly didn't work, but as to how they were destroyed, it was most likely the result of **_collateral damage_**, which is how Krushers create significant structural damage as they repeatedly attempt to destroy a different **_target_**, which itself could be almost anything, since Krushers _overdistribute their weight_ when trying to do so.
   
   Since Thurein was evacuated before any Krushers could've reached the area, there's might've originally been a pocket of Krushers stuck behind the barriers, though a passing rain shower could've agitated the Krushers and caused them to break through the barriers _(Ruiz casually mentions this but doesn't expand on it, though the context for it comes up soon after during the Apartment scene)_
   
   As far as Ruiz knows, that intersection was the first and only time Krusher Barriers of such design were installed because, ignoring the past 5 years they've spent isolated from the outside world, it was a relatively recent unproven development though it could've had better usage in urban/developed areas.
   
   There's also two bright yellow "_SLOW_" signs broken off from their sign posts, located beside the outer edge structures which were orientated to face northbound or southbound drivers, since the barriers would've also been crash hazards.
   
   
   _**Ruiz**_
   _Gradually starting jogging ahead, and looks down the length of the highways where they turn out of view a hundred metres south, leaning over to try and get a better angle._
   
   "Still no Krushers? Well, at least we were able to make a bit more process."
   
   _**Frank**_
   "The next town is 5km out, guess we'll have to stay the night in Thurein."
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   _Glances over to the west at the setting sun, with the undamaged barrier in view, as his expression gradually becomes one of more urgency_
   
   "... Stay here."
   
   _Runs down the highway exit._
   
   
   **_Cale_**
   _(asking Frank)_ "What's Ruiz doing?"
   
   **_Frank_**
   "Apparently there's a staircase we can take down into Thurein.
   I doubt the town has even been touched by Krushers if it really was evacuated like you said, though I'm not too keen on waltzing right into the city-centre... Or I guess, town-centre?
   Anyhow, Ruiz visited Thurein the day before we got dragged into this Hell, so I'm taking him for his word."
   
   **_Cale_**
   "..? You call it 'Hell'? I'm not religious but.."
   
   **_Frank_**
   "..Now that I think about it, this day has felt more like we're hitchhiking or something, the only Krushers we've even seen today were back in Chinelo."
   
   _Looks over at Dave_
   
   "Hey Dave! Do you know where all the Krushers went?"
   
   **_Dave_**
   "No idea, we probably just got lucky."
   
   **_Frank_**
   _playful tone_ "C'mon!"
   
   **_Dave_**
   "Maybe the passing rain showers in the area a few days ago? I don't know, what'd you want me to say?"
   
   _Conversation gradually muffles out until it's inaudible._
  
  Ruiz leads SST 1 down a turn along the highway exit towards the observation area, which is located next to the mouth of a river that carved out the cliffside and passes through Thurein, of which there's a wide unobstructed view of; The winding staircase down along the cliffside is also still intact.
  
  Ruiz immediately notices the lack of obvious structural collateral damage caused by Krushers, which have clear signs such as gouges in buildings matching a Krusher's profile, grazing damage to the corners of buildings near turns and intersections, and seemingly random elevated damage caused by flying debris, except for a couple signs of damage that were most likely caused by natural deterioration over the years.
  
  There's also a conspicuous Rossgivo flag hanging down in the still fairly low wind, located in a public park near the centre of Thurein, which Ruiz points out as a sign that the town has certainly gone untouched by Krushers since any conspicuous flags the "_SSTs_" had come across recently were almost always already taken down by Krushers, though the low wind does somewhat mask that detail in the moment.
  
  The still-standing flag and lack of Krusher structural damage puts Ruiz under the false impression that Thurein has gone untouched by Krushers, so Dave doesn't end up using his drone, and Ruiz leads SST 1 down into Thurein with very little caution.
  
  In actuality, the first Krusher in Thurein had reached the town by chance only a day prior though the other highway connection on its southern side, and was hidden by the buildings as it had attempted to reach the flag pole in the public park but was at a complete stand-still because of the low wind, so the Krusher doesn't create any noise that'd alert SST 1 of its presence.
  
  _SCENE: THUREIN_
   The observation area has a winding staircase leading down along the cliffside, meant to provide easier access to residents but also acts as an alternative route into Thurein - Because the town largely only consists of 2 floor tall buildings, except for a few buildings 3 to 4 floors tall in its central area, the area provides a wide, largely unobstructed view of Thurein for SST 1.
   
   There's mounted pay-to-use metallic binoculars in now highly sun-bleached light blue paint, located along the metal railings by the cliff edge, which Ruiz ignores, instead using his own traditional higher quality pair stored in his hiking backpack _(showing the large number of rations and survival equipment Ruiz compacted into his)_ to survey Thurein from above before they all head down into the town.
   
   It's our first look at the Netherlands-style architecture of Rossgivo - An important aspect of the story of KRUSHERS, as there's plenty of walkable cities with narrow streets that make Krushers feel more threatening, even their highly common but low intelligence "Wall" variant.
   
   Aside from Thurein's somewhat unique architecture, and the lack of any stereotypical large vehicle pileups commonly seen in apocalyptic stories _(there's a small number of parked vehicles mostly near residential areas, with some scattered between a handful of businesses)_, Thurein appears to be a small abandoned rural Netherlands town, but the _Flag of Rossgivo_ located in its central plaza shows it's part of a fictional nation, _Rossgivo_.
   
   Some buildings have a couple broken windows, there's road signs, mail boxes, and trash bins which have fallen into the streets, and there's a noticeable amount of overgrowth emerging from cracks that formed in the decaying asphalt and building foundations.
   
   Ruiz is aware that Thurein only has 2 highway connections which are both one-ways, and the other highway is merely a couple hundred metres to the south which connects to the same highways from earlier. Those highways are the only practical way to enter Thurein, besides a convoluted series of old dirt trails and roads that no Krushers could possibly use.
   
   But Ruiz is still surprised that Thurein seemingly went untouched by Krushers, with very minor structural damage most likely caused by mere natural deterioration, especially its still-standing flag pole in its central plaza, which pokes out above the surrounding buildings, albeit is currently hanging down and only blowing slightly in the low wind.
   
   _(Ruiz is also a bit surprised the low wind had lasted all day - it was apparently one of the reasons they left the Stronghold that day for their "**expedition**", but Ruiz expected it to only last till noon, though he just brushes it off as lucky weather.)_
   
   Since structural damage is normally collateral damage from Krushers - whether its large gouges in the profile of a Krusher's body, grazing to the corners of buildings, or shattered windows caused by flying pieces of debris it creates - the complete lack of it as he scans over the many structures of Thurein gives off the false impression that Krushers never entered Thurein, only concealed by the recent arrival of the first Krusher only a few days prior, whose damage was hidden by surrounding buildings as it struggles to reach the flag pole in the central plaza.
   
   However, Ruiz points out the still-standing flag pole as proof of there being no Krushers, since stray flag poles SSTs have found recently were almost always already collapsed by a Krusher, unless they were obscured by surrounding structures or terrain that kept them hidden from view, so the fact Thurein still had a conspicuous flag pole left untouched heavily implied there hadn't been any Krushers in Thurein thus far; He even checks the level of overgrowth on nearby streets, since they'd get torn up by a passing Krusher, which he confirms hasn't been the case.
   
   However, Ruiz couldn't see the overgrowth on the road where the highway exit led to, and the complete lack of obvious Krusher damage was because the first Krusher in Thurein only reached the city a few days earlier by pure chance, but had almost no other targets to go after besides the flag which he only reaches and collapses during the Store scene, and the structural damage it caused was heavily obscured from Ruiz's perspective.
   
   Ruiz tells Dave to set up the "_drone_" - apparently stored in the grey plastic case hooked onto the side of Dave's hiking backpack with a hook, since Dave goes to open it, and begins fiddling around with its contents - which will allow them to view the streets of Thurein from above "_just to safe_", though mostly just because Ruiz himself wrote down that SSTs should do such a procedure, and doubts that there's any Krushers in Thurein at all.
   
   However, the drone wasn't able to spot the structural damage caused by the lone Krusher because of how minimal it was, and the Krusher had burrowed itself into a building that hid itself from the drone's camera.
   
   _(outdated drafts below, start here at 12:30)_
   
   Ruiz figures Thurein was evacuated long before the Krushers ever reached the area: He knows that during the fall of Chinelo, an evacuation order for civilian population within 30km of the city was sent out when it started getting overrun by Krushers in the later hours January 2nd, 2065; This included Thurein, located just 20km away from Chinelo, and would explain why there's hardly any structural damage caused by Krushers since it's typically collateral damage whenever Krushers try to attack a target _(as Ruiz explains this all to SST 1, we get more looks at the Netherlands-style architecture Thurein has.)_
   
   Bringing up Thurein's distance to Chinelo reminds Ruiz to have Cale cross out Thurein as "overrun", a term Ruiz hesitates a bit to mention as it doesn't apply to Thurein at all, so he decides on the spot to change it to "abandoned" instead so that it doesn't conflict with the other towns and cities already marked as such.
   
   ...
   
   There's no sign of the _New Frontlines_ in Thurein which SST 1 is currently searching for, however Ruiz notes that the "_9th Expedition_" took a similar route a couple kilometres east, when the prior route SST 1 took offscreen that led them towards Thurein, was then blocked by a large number of Krushers and forced them to take a different route. But that expedition went 9km further south than they currently are without finding a sign of the new frontlines, so Ruiz didn't expect to find anything of the sort in Thurein (Ruiz doesn't actually directly mention "New Frontlines", but it's made clear that he's referring to it, as told in the next paragraph.)
   
   
   Ruiz suspects that the hilly terrain is a potential location for the "_New Frontlines_" since Krushers seemingly weren't specialized for travelling on anything other than flat terrain, so they're easily slowed down by steep inclines, but he believes that, _at worst_, they're located much further south where the hills are at their highest, which would most certainly be heavily fortified judging by the large amount of land that the SSTs _only know_ where lost after the fall of the original frontlines, but Ruiz is hopeful that the military would live up to Rossgivo's historical title of being the world's most powerful nation.
   
   
   
   Ruiz then reminds Cale to cross out Thurein, sarcastically asking him if he wants to search the entirety of Thurein first "_just to make sure_", since Cale seemingly hadn't tried to do so until Ruiz told him to, though Cale just forgot about it largely since it's his 1st long-term expedition, as well as in SST 1.
   
   It appears to have merely slipped his mind, as Cale quickly places his lantern on the ground and takes out a small folded-up map from his hiking backpack, which he unfolds, revealing it to be a map of "_Rossgivo_" with its rail and road networks clearly marked, and has been drawn on in different coloured pens: A small area in the northeast is entirely marked off in black stripes with a solid defined border; The city of "_Chinelo_" is located south of that area and is marked by a large yellow dot, and appears to be a hub for the country's northern railway networks; A large number of towns and cities in a manner that emanates south of Chinelo are crossed out in red; We also see the nation "_Millow_" along Rossgivo's mountainous eastern border, plus the borders of Alcrassia, Purcu, and Maltova but we don't see their names _(partly because they aren't relevant.)_
   
   Cale puts the map on a nearby grey plastic bench so he can use a red pen to cross out Thurein, while remarking on how they're already 20km out from the "_Stronghold_" (likely "Stronghold Fox" considering the episode's title, with "Fox" indicating there's multiple strongholds.)
   
   
   Cale casually asks for a piece of gum from Nathan, a man with black hair, who refuses since he has no obligation to give Cale any, but more so because he only has one pack of gum since Ruiz limits each member to bringing one nonessential item and food item on expeditions.
   
   Nathan asks Cale, who had transferred to SST 1 from SST 4, if his old SST leader was "_Gavis_", to which Cale confirms that he was - It's also the first time "_SST_" is mentioned - Nathan then asks if Gavis didn't let them bring nonessential items, since Gavis is much more laidback than Ruiz, so he thought Cale would've tried to bring something, or if he just didn't bring his own candy.
   
   Cale says he brought nothing else besides the bare necessities, but is surprised that he could've just brought his own nonessential items, though he explains that the reason he didn't is because Gavis would've just guilt tripped them for not helping him by carrying more equipment, so it wasn't ever a habit of his.
   
   Ruiz checks up on Dave, who's finished setting up the drone, but is visibly having complications with the drone. Dave tells Ruiz that the drone's battery is dead, despite having ensured that it was plugged in throughout the previous night.
  
  As SST 1 strolls through Thurein at ground level, it's clear that the town has visibly decayed, with plants and weeds growing in the cracks of streets, and paint withering off the sides of buildings, with faded wall art celebrating _Rossgivo's 1000 year anniversary of independence_ in an alleyway Ruiz instinctively chose to move SST 1 through.
  
  
  
  
  Ruiz decides to overlook Cale's disruption since it was quickly resolved, and takes the chance to tell Cale to use his boxcutters when opening the boxes in the storage room to avoid dulling the blades on his pocket knife _(a sentence Ruiz starts over from the beginning when he stammers on his words mid-sentence upon finding the storage room himself when peering into a room beside him after he walked over to Cale who was by the Calendar)_, then turns around and starts walking back to the front of the store.
  
  As Ruiz is walking back to the front of the store, Cale expresses how his _(albeit minor)_ disruption to be a bad habit he picked up from his time in SST 3, as it was led by _"Gavis"_ (who's presumably more laidback than Ruiz), so Ruiz walks back and reassures Cale on how his disruption wasn't something he'd consider to make Cale a potential hinderance, and his habit only shows that.
  
  Ruiz first reminds Cale that most of the people left from their _"Division"_, even those who are veterans from the _"Millow Civil War"_, don't dare to leave the _"Stronghold"_ out of fear of Krushers; Ruiz also points out that it makes Gavis a great _"SST leader"_ from the get-go, as he's hardly afraid of Krushers and was fully willing to take up such a role, largely because of his deployment in the first military operations against Krushers when they first appeared 20 years prior which made him accustomed to Krushers and also taught Gavis how to deal with Krushers.
  
  Cale adds onto Gavis's expertise, commenting on how he himself quickly became accustomed to Krushers since Gavis would repeatedly exploit their predictable behaviour seemingly without any sort of seriousness or effort but not in a way that made him feel careless, which made it far easier for Cale to remain composed while dealing with a Krusher.
  
  Ruiz gets a bit sidetracked by Cale's comment, replying to it saying how he would've made Gavis the squad leader of SST 1 had his old age not limited his physical capability too much for him to take on physically demanding expeditions, which was the main reason Ruiz chose Cale to be transferred into SST 1 instead - besides avoiding organizational issues with SST 3 - whom Ruiz himself described as being the 2nd best option.
  
  We're reminded of the Calendar as we then get a close-up of it, since Ruiz has brushed it off as irrelevant by this point.
  
  
  Ruiz glances at the Calendar before he returns to the front of the store, then realises that the last date marked off on the Calendar was on a _Thursday, indicating nobody came into work on Friday_ and updated the Calendar, which he confirms would've happened after finding the previous Calendar at the far end of the staffroom table, with each date of the month marked off.
  
  It also wasn't because the store was closed that day since 3 employees had marked their shifts on the Calendar using different coloured pens _(which had largely faded leaving it only faintly visible)_, who would've all had work on the 2nd _(another detail that was present on the previous Calendar, but with 2 more employees who presumably didn't get the chance to mark their shifts on the new Calendar.)_
  
  Considering this information, Ruiz figures the city they're currently in, _Thurein_, was evacuated before the _"Krushers"_ reached it, which he explains in further detail after Cale asks him how he got to that conclusion seemingly from the Calendar alone, since Ruiz made that comment after inspecting the Calendar.
  

  
  
  
  We cut to a closeup shot that follows an old red soda can as it's blown off a table by the wind and rolls into the nearby street, but as it slows down, we begin to hear the loud, distant but approaching noise of a Krusher tearing up the street beneath it as it quickly rushes towards the soda can.
  
  We don't see the Krusher as it gets close to the soda can until right before it makes contact, when its massive body casts a large shadow that envelops the area around the soda can, before suddenly cutting to an aerial shot of the same street - as indicated by a building down the street which has a very distinct, uniquely detailed roof - as the bright red rectangular body of the Krusher that's almost as wide as the entire street, gets carried far past the soda can from its sheer momentum, and crashes deep into the building ahead of it _(the same one with the distinct roof, since the bright red Krusher would be the most eye catching, so our eyes will be led to that building as we follow the Krusher)_, creating a large dust cloud as it does so. 
  
  
  
  We cut back to the small store with Ruiz by the storefront presumably looking out for Krushers, and the rest of SST 1 are in the staffroom: Dave is replacing the batteries on the foldable drone _(showing what the black case was holding)_, Cale is searching through the storage room, and the others are gathered around the table playing a card game they found amongst the shelfs.
  
  Ruiz notices a distant storm approaching their location while staying outside at the front of the store looking out for any Krushers, he goes back inside to the staffroom where Cale is unpacking boxes from the storage room, while the rest of SST 1 casually plays a card game they found in the store shelfs around a table _(SST 1 is doing this because they're waiting for Cale to finish going through the storage room, though Ruiz was dignified enough to mention that he held up Cale for a while with a personal theory of his, which we learn when Cale's asks them about their rather laidback behaviour of playing a card game, just so Ruiz doesn't have to worry about anybody else potentially agitating a Krusher.)_
  
  Ruiz tells SST 1 that they need to quickly find a place to settle down for the night to avoid getting caught in the approaching storm, which can greatly agitate Krushers purely from its rainfall, something that often results in usual, seemingly erratic damage caused by Krushers.
  
  As they're moving from alleyway to alleyway, making their way to a nearby apartment building, Ruiz gets confronted by a Krusher in a pedestrianized street barely big enough for it to fit in, which he manages to distract using a smoke grenade from a side pocket on his hiking backpack, providing SST 1 with enough time to quickly run past the Krusher.
  
  _SCENE: ENCOUNTER_
   Soon after SST 1 leaves the store, with Ruiz in the lead, they're moving from alleyway to alleyway trying to find to settle down for the night to avoid getting caught in the approaching storm, until Ruiz gets confronted by a Krusher in a pedestrian street lined with stores barely big enough for the Krusher to fit through, and the Krusher destroys any tables, chairs, awnings, and flower pots that were left outside in front of those stores.
   
   Ruiz first steps out into the street looking down one end of it, then quickly snaps his head around to the opposite end as he almost immediately begins to hear the unmistakable loud grinding noise of an approaching Krusher, which he spots, then shouts out to the rest of SST 1 to stop in order to keep them out of view from the Krusher, though Ruiz himself barely moves and attempts to reach for something on his hiking backpack but ends up freezing in place. 
   
   Ruiz keeps his composure and remains still the best he can, and the Krusher inexplicably stops accelerating though it continues tearing up the pavement of the street as it slows down, and showers the area with debris once it comes to a halt in front of Ruiz.
   
   We get an upwards-panning shot of the Krusher once it has come to a stop: The Krusher has a large rectangular almost as wide as the entire street and tall enough to reach above the handrail of 2nd floor balcony of a restaurant right next to it, with 9 equally spaced eyes in a 3 by 3 grid, and has darkish red, rough-looking skin damaged by all the debris it had just slammed into.
   
   The Krusher initially stares down at Ruiz, but soon drifts its focus away and begins looking around the surrounding area, and while Ruiz carefully makes sure to only move when it isn't looking at him as he grabs a DIY-looking smoke grenade with blue custom 3D-printed parts from the right side pocket of his hiking backpack.
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   _(steps out into the street and looks down the right end of the street - Almost immediately, there's a loud but distant grinding noise quickly approaching from the other end of the street, which Ruiz quickly snaps his head around over to, and spots a fast approaching Krusher, making him jump.)_
   
   "Stop! Don't move!"
   
   _(Ruiz freezes in place, but he keeps his composure the best he can, and reaches out his left hand towards the rest of SST 1, shouting at them to "Stop!" to keep them out of view of the Krusher, and "Don't move!" so they stay inside the alleyway - Ruiz shows no concern over the noise he's making, though this is repeated soon later to make it clear that visible movement is what agitates Krushers.)_
   
   We cut to the bottom half of the Krusher, grinding against and tearing up the street before it inexplicably stops accelerating, but still manages to tear up some of the street as it slows down, and sends a shower of debris from broken furniture _(left outside in front of the businesses lining the street)_ towards Ruiz as it comes to a halt in front of him.
   
   Ruiz, who already had his left arm raised up in front of his head to shield himself from the debris _(made up of broken tables, chairs, awnings, flower pots, and chalkboards)_, pays close attention to the Krusher's eyes which initially stare down at Ruiz, but soon drift away as the Krusher starts looking around its surroundings despite Ruiz, who it seemingly just tried to attack, standing still in front of it only a couple metres away like it doesn't even notice him whenever he's not moving.
   
   This is further supported by Ruiz only moving when the Krusher isn't looking at him, as he tries to reach for an item in the right side pocket of his hiking backpack, timing his movements when the Krusher looks away as he reaches closer towards the item.
   
   We switch camera positions to get a better look of this, however the item is left obscured until Ruiz successfully retrieves it: The item is a make-shift smoke grenade in an old spray paint can, with three blue custom 3D-printed components of a cap, pin _(a small rectangular piece)_, and a lever which detaches the cap if pushed down and released, unless the pin isn't pulled out beforehand as it serves as a break between the lever and cap.
   
   Whenever the Krusher looks away, Ruiz pulls out pin and holds onto it so it doesn't fall, pushes down on the lever, then tosses the smoke grenade - without looking - in the general direction of a nearby cafe on the other side of the street with large glass storefront windows, to try and get the Krusher to crash deep into its interior.
   
   When Ruiz releases the lever, it flicks upward and detaches the cap as it does so, which lets a smoky opaque white gas stream out of the canister, which agitates the Krusher that then proceeds to slowly move backwards like it's charging up its energy _(though the street is so narrow that it partially crashes into the storefront behind it)_, before suddenly charging forward as we hear a loud muffled slamming noise inside the Krusher _(its body fluids quickly slamming into the front of its body, propelling itself forward.)_
   
   After the Krusher slams into the cafe - creating a large gouging hole in its storefront, and even partially crashes into the small store next to it - SST 1 quickly runs across the street into an alleyway on the other side once Ruiz tells them to do so while the Krusher remains stuck.
   
   As SST 1 makes their way down the alleyway, the camera stays in place and doesn't follow them, instead slowly panning upwards to look up at the approaching storm, with a lightning strike acting as a transition.
   
  After the encounter, we cut to nighttime where SST 1 is staying in an relatively clean apartment as a fierce thunderstorm storm rages outside, and we're shown more of their experience such as perpetrations to use drones for surveying, along with their attitude towards Krushers predictable behaviors, which they joke about.
  
  _SCENE: APARTMENT_
   SST 1 is staying in an old but relatively clean apartment for the night as a fierce thunderstorm rages outside, and between the loud cracks of thunder, large unnatural crashing noises can be heard in the distance. Ruiz identifies the noise as the unusual behavior of Krushers when they attempt to attack falling rain, as is merely joked about as they're well accustomed to it.

   _**Ruiz**_
   _(fidgeting with something, then notices the noise of Krushers)_ Hear that? Sounds like they're trying to kill the rain.
   
   _**Cale**_
   Well clearly, they feel threatened by falling water. Anyway, you wanna hear something that sounds even stupider?

   _**Ruiz**_
   What is it?
   
   _**Cale**_
   Before we got caught up in this mess, there was a study on the Krushers movement, like overall. And what they found was, throughout the day, Krushers tend to travel _**west to east**_ _(chuckles to himself)_

   _**Ruiz**_
   As in.. wait.. _they follow the clouds??_

   _**Cale**_
   Apparently so!
   
   _**Ruiz**_
   Were there any sources for it? I mean, wouldn't something inevitably distract them? Clouds don't move all that fast, and they're up in the sky too-
   
   _(Gets interrupted by loud nearby thunder, only a second after its lightning)_
   
   Good grief! How close was that?! Say, _(looks at Dave)_ we never did use that drone today.
   
   _**Dave**_
   _(looks up at Ruiz)_ What? Do you want to use it now? _(gestures at the storm outside)_ Out there?
   
   _**Ruiz**_
   Oh! No, no, I meant _after_ it clears up. We're about 30km out from the Stronghold, so maybe we'll see something... _(stares outside)_
   
   ..I know it's not the best time, but I'll try looking around _(grabs binoculars from his backpack, then walks out onto the balcony, which is sheltered from the rain)_
  
  As Ruiz looks out around the vicinity from the hotel balcony using his pair of binoculars, one member of SST 1 comments about the stormy weather beginning to pass by Thurein, which has now died to a milder rain showers, the thunder has become audibly distant, and we don't see any lightning strikes besides their flashes - the general direction of which show that the storm is moving towards Chinelo, and a sideways shot from Ruiz's right maintains that sense of direction kept from the Highway scene.
  
  The day after, SST 1 finally reaches the 'new frontlines', however they laid in complete ruin and any surviving sections clearly had rushed and lackluster construction, with frontline trenches largely resembling more so of ditches given their rough appearance.
  
  SST 1 would find that Nicole was also in ruin, with no signs of a functional society of Rossgivo.
  
  

  
  _--STRONGHOLD--_
  
  There's then a cut to the front entrance of "_Perksons Power Plant_", as labeled by a sign on its perimeter fence - It's a relatively large nuclear power plant which uses _Thorium_, a safer alternative to Uranium, and is clearly far from Stronghold Fox which is in the ruins of a city, _Chinelo_, while the power plant is in a rural flat open area surrounded by farmland, though all the crops have long since died leaving the fields as a rather barren brown.
  
  However, the power plant is close enough to be encompassed in the same storm, which is more fierce in its area with heavier rainfall, stronger winds, and more frequent lightning, indicating that the Stronghold is in the weaker outer regions of the storm.
  
  There's cuts to the power plant's reactor hall, turbine hall, the chamber for Unit 1, then the control room where Unit 1 is the only one out of three 3 units currently online, and is apparently running at a very low power level of merely 1%, though there's no indication that it's caused by something broken.
  
  There's a lightning strike every couple of seconds on one of the power plant's two lightning rods located on opposite sides of the site, but eventually, there's an offshoot from one of these strikes that although is much weaker than the initial strike, manages to take out one of 4 supporting guidewires for a radio antenna located on the roof of the reactor hall.
  
  The antenna initially remains standing, but the strong winds soon causes it to tilt in the direction that the missing guidewire would've prevented, and the stress on the other 3 guidewires causes them to give way, and the top half of the antenna breaks off and crashes through the roof, rupturing the main coolant line for Unit 1 which happened to pass right below it.
  
  This causes Unit 1, which has inadvertently been supplying almost all of Stronghold Fox's power even without any human interaction, to automatically shut down as a safety measure.
  
  _SCENE: SHORTAGE_
   Right after the hotel scene, we cut to the lit-up entrance of a power plant, its Turbine Hall, then its control room, all without people. The control room shows 3 reactor units, and despite the use of Rossgivian, only 1 unit seems functional, being lit up green unlike the other two which are red.
   
   Back outside the nuclear power plant, we see three square building segments - housing for the reactor units - and a lightning strike that takes out a tall, narrow cooling tower, which collapses into the power plant, rupturing several pipes, leaking a white gas.
   
   We go back to the control room, specifically its data log, which identifies the gas leak as coolant for Unit 1, causing Unit 1 to go into an automatic emergency shutdown. We hear the mechanical hum of Unit 1 slowly ceasing, then the power plant's lights switch to red emergency lights, as the street lights _(which there's occasional gaps between)_ in the local area all gradually go out, leading to complete darkness.
  
  In the Control Room of Perksons Power Plant, we see that Unit 1, only one of three reactor units currently online, has been running at a very minimal level for possibly years, with its power generation efficiency staying below 1%. This is further emphasized by the faint hum of Unit 1 that we hear beforehand.
  
  Perksons Power Plant automatically shuts down its last operating reactor unit due to a breach in its main coolant pumps, caused by an antenna that broke off from a radio receiver after it was struck by lightning, which then crashed through the roof of the reactor hall and struck the main coolant pumps for reactor Unit 1 on its way down, resulting in the automatic shutdown of Unit 1 when the breach and leakage of coolant was detected.
  
  Because of this, Stronghold Fox loses a significant portion of its power supply, which despite only happening by chance since the people stationed at the power plant during the Fall of Chinelo had fled without shutting down the reactors, the stronghold's _own generators and batteries_ which were specifically _meant to sustain its power supply_ hadn't been adequately designed to even meet the standards for Krusher Strongholds (brought up later by Kinn) and could only sustain the stronghold's current rate of power consumption for a week until it has to be reduced to avoid power shortages.
  
  After the power plant shuts down, we cut to a grey dashboard full of dials, gauges, indicators, buttons, and switches as an alarm begins blaring out from one of it's speakers - its clearly not in the control room, but in a utility room with large generators and batteries lining one of the walls, presumably located _(in the basement of the SST HQ)_ in Stronghold Fox - it's then shown that the alarm is going off because the Stronghold is now consuming more power than it's producing, clearly having been caused in part by the reactor shutdown.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We see what appears to be an old video of a graduation party a spiky black-haired kid accidently took on their phone, judging by the shaky large movements of the camera, and especially the complete switch in tone with 4 University-aged boys attempting to take a group photo at their graduation party _(supported by the background conversation we hear, and brief glimpses we get of the surrounding gym it's being held in as the black-haired kid fumbles with his phone.)_
  
  The 4 University graduates are trying to take a group photo in front of a banner attached to the stage which reads, _"Graduating Class of 2064"_, but the black-haired kid who set up the phone accidentally took a video instead of a timed photo.
  
  As the shot gradually pans out showing that _it is an old video_ someone is watching on their phone _(specifically from 12/20/2064, telling us that school years follow the Calendar year without focusing on the minor detail)_, the boys pose for the photo, but from the lack of sound that normally signals when a timed photo is taken, the black-haired kid realises his mistake, before going up the phone and ending the video recording.
  
  
  The shot slowly pans out as the video plays, giving us confirmation that it is an old video _(from December 20, 2064)_ someone is watching on their phone _(which has no signal.)_ Once the video ends, the person watching it turns off the phone. The reflection reveals them to be the same person that set up the phone - Kinn, who in stark contrast has a somber and dissatisfied expression, having been reminiscing on their past life.
  
  Kinn is laying on his bed in an apartment with only a few personal belongings, one of which is his framed _Degree in Engineering_ that tells us his name - _Kinn Shuapa_. There's 2 slightly see-through curtains with an off-beige colour that splits _what appears to have been the living room_ in half _(but barely covers the room's 7 metre length - probably meant to be shower curtains)_, as evidenced by their out of place appearance alongside the room's dark wooden floor, light brown walls, and a window that cuts across them _(plus its lack of doors, and being right next to the kitchen, but we don't see those yet.)_
  
  The curtains split apart the living room, with each side being turned into two 'bedrooms' with a _questionable_ level of privacy (the bedrooms belong to Kinn, and Fredrick.)
  
  Kinn notices the curtain is partially pulled away, revealing an empty untidy bed on the other side which although we only get a small glimpse of, seems to another roommate's 'bedroom' similar to the one Kinn has, whom they woke up before, which Kinn finds unusual but brushes off as he gets ready for the day.
  
  Although we've just seen a similar example in the "Store" scene, Kinn's morning routine drifts even farther from the apocalyptic setting as it looks rather normal, with Kinn using appliances, and even taking a shower, albeit there's a very noticeable lack of personal belongings besides essentials, to the point that most products in the apartment aren't commercialized but instead appear to have been made by survivors after the society fell.
  
  These products have very generic packaging _(mostly pure white labeling on equally generic containers, containing only necessary/important information about what the product, such as potential health risks, nutritional information for food, and a list of ingredients in case there's certain ones that people have allergies to.)_
  
  As Kinn cooks a pot of mashed potatoes as part of a healthy balanced meal, showing that he's focused on healthy high protein foods and not a random generic breakfast, he looks out through a window in the kitchen, and we pan out to see that Kinn's residing in an apartment building located within a walled-off section of a much larger city that lies in ruin, and was left to rot for what appears to have been many years.
  
  We cut back to Kinn: He has short spiky black hair, and in place of the white sleeveless T-shirt and blue striped boxers he was initially wearing, he donned on a blue jacket with _Nicole University_ branding, and black pants; When he leaves the apartment, he puts on blue black-sole sneakers with white laces.
  
  Kinn takes the pot of mashed potatoes off the stove and turns off the heat, then we hear someone at the front door, Kinn's friend and roommate, Fredrick.
  
  From their conversation, we learn that they're residing within the aforementioned Stronghold, that the nuclear power plant we saw shutdown was its main source of power, and is now only being sustained by "emergency generators" - Details Fredrick heard about at "HQ".
  
  _SCENE: FREDERICK_
   Just as Kinn makes himself a bowl of mashed potatoes - which is only about a quarter of the mashed potatoes, presumably for other people living in the apartment - someone tries to open the front door, but knocks after finding it locked.
   
   Kinn looks through the door's peephole to see who it is: It's Frederick, who Kinn lets inside, and Frederick explains that he forgot his keys to the apartment.
   
   Frederick is noticeably younger than Kinn, he has orange hair in the same spiky hairstyle as Kinn, and he's wearing a white _"Scorpions"_ hockey jersey with black pants.
   
   Kinn points out Frederick's hairstyle like he regularly does something odd, so Frederick mentions _"There's probably only one hairstylist in the entire stronghold"_, telling us that they're residing within _Stronghold Fox_ (It's in the title, which also indicates there's several strongholds), and gives us a broad idea as to how many people are there.
   
   Frederick notices the bowl of mashed potatoes Kinn is holding in his left hand, and asks why he didn't use the rations they have. Kinn, unaware of the stronghold's power shortage caused by the reactor shutdown, gets confused and just points out that the potatoes can be grown in the stronghold either way.
   
   Frederick tries to argue that the stronghold's power is only being supplied by emergency generators, due to a nuclear reactor which was the stronghold's main source of power having gone offline the previous night - after noticing Kinn was completely oblivious to it, Fredrick realises that Kinn _couldn't have known about it_, because Kinn doesn't work with the "SSTs", so he drops the argument.
   
   Kinn is curious as to what this _"reactor shutdown"_ entails, especially on how it'll affect the stronghold, so he asks Fredrick for more information, but Fredrick only heard a short summary of it from one of the reactor's former employee's at "HQ", and doesn't know anything more.
   
   Fredrick says the people at HQ are trying to keep it a secret, which is how Fredrick realized that Kinn couldn't of heard about it beforehand, and he's well aware that he already went well past the point of keeping it a secret.
  
  Kinn, after learning about the stronghold's power shortage caused by the reactor shutdown, goes to the SST HQ where Fredrick heard about it to learn more, who follows after him. At the HQ, we learn what SSTs are, its ongoing personnel shortage, the specifics of Perksons Power Plant, and the formation of SST 6 to restore Perksons' supply of power to Stronghold Fox.
  
  We also learn of the nation Rossgivo, what Stronghold Fox is for, and that it's located in Chinelo.
  
  NOTE:
   The Rossgivo Government sets an exclusion zone near the frontlines to protect civilians from the threat of Krushers: No Civilians Residences and/or non-essential places of civilian activity allowed _within 20km of the frontlines_; No Civilians allowed within 12km of the frontlines.
   
   When frontlines fell back to near Chinelo at the start of 2062, only the city's northern outskirts were impacted by the new exclusion zone since the city-centre was 23km from the frontlines, though many businesses in its unimpacted areas would still pull out of Chinelo due to its vicinity.
   
   However, Chinelo's major rail and most of its agricultural industry went unaffected as they were considered essential work, its rail network being a vital logistical hub for transporting supplies to the frontlines.
   
   Chinelo's cleared-out northern outskirts were repurposed for housing military personnel, for storing supplies and equipment, then later on with a grid of 12 city blocks being incorporated into Stronghold Fox _(albeit skimping out on important components needed for the minimum 3 years of isolated sustainment, and barely had enough capacity to house 30,000 of Chinelo's then 1.1 million population just before the city fell to Krushers.)_
   
   Despite the nearby frontlines, most of Chinelo's population chose to stay in place, only decreasing the civilian population by 400k by 2065, most of whom were evicted from their homes in the northern outskirts but took the chance to move to previously desired locations, and rarely out of fear from Krushers _(which was already becoming uncommon since Krushers had been around for 12 years by that point, so people were already accustomed to their existence.)_
   
   
   Strongholds are large shelters designed specifically for protecting people from Krushers, there has to be enough equipment and supplies for the local area to sustain themselves for 3 years until the military can rescue them (usually through the use of helicopters.)
   
   However, in the case of Stronghold Fox (mostly since Krushers had already been around for the past 12 years, creating overconfidence in the military's abilities) It lacked several key components for long-term survival, such as the _lack of a sustainable source of power_, it had a very low capacity for the city of Chinelo alone, which still had over 1 million people in spite of the nearby frontlines.
   
   As such, Stronghold Fox struggles to sustain 30,000 people, even with significant looting by SSTs, which later motivated the start of long expeditions out from the stronghold in search of the new military frontlines (partly due to them being unaware of Slammers or Gears.)
   
   These points are briefly brought up by John when Kinn questions him about the stronghold's own power supply.
   
   
   Stronghold Fox's main source of power is _Perksons Power Plant_, a Thorium-based nuclear power plant that was left online for 5 years but continued supplying power as all other power plants started going offline, and became the stronghold's main - and practically only - source of power.
   
   All anyone knows is that it suddenly stopped supplying power the previous night, possibly due to a storm that was raging in the area at the time, or it went offline because of the complete lack of maintenance. 
   
   It's located in the southeast outskirts of Chinelo, 12km south of Stronghold Fox, which normally takes 12 hours roundtrip on foot due to the threat of Krushers, and many blocked passages that the Krushers created.
  
  _SCENE: SST HQ_
   The SST HQ is located in a former office building, where they store equipment, documentation, and conduct radio communications and operate drones to assist on local expeditions. It serves as a base of operations for SSTs, who scavenge and survey the areas outside of Stronghold Fox, with the idea of SSTs created by Ruiz Kurnell.
   
   Fredrick leads Kinn into a former conference room on the 4th floor (the highest floor) judging by the room's rectangular shape, and what the building used to be - It's now a charting room for SST expeditions, with shelfs full of documents lining the walls that block most of the windows.
   
   There's _**a map of Rossgivo**_ pinned on a wall: _An area in the northeast is marked in black_, Chinelo is marked in yellow, and _nearby towns and cities are crossed off in red_; We also see the borders of Alcrassia, Purcu, and Millow on the sides of the map - Only Millow's name is readable however.
   
   We get a closeup of the map when Kinn glances at it, with the focus on Chinelo, and an X along the right border of the black-marked area which goes along a mountain range on Rossgivo's eastern border with Millow _(implied in ep #2) marking the first appearances of Krushers_.
   
   Garrett, the leader of SST 2, is talking with John about the Perksons Power Plant _(which isn't immediately clear)_ on the other end of the room. They have a map of Chinelo laid out on a table, with many different routes out from the Stronghold - an outline of it - marked out in alternating colours, and are labeled with unique names.
   
   Kinn immediately assumes John is the former employee Fredrick mentioned, since he's wearing a white full-body uniform with a red _"Perksons"_ logo, a company Kinn doesn't know about, instead basing it purely on the oddity of it alone.
   
   Garrett overhears this and notices Kinn and Fredrick from across the room; he knows Kinn through Fredrick, and is well aware that he doesn't work at the HQ, so he asks Kinn if Fredrick bought him there for whatever reason.
   
   Kinn explains that he's there to ask about the stronghold's power shortage which began the previous night when a nuclear power plant went offline, specifically a former employee who worked at that nuclear power plant, before asking John if he's that former employee.
   
   John, who's completely unsurprised as he's wearing the uniform, tries to say it was Garrett's idea, who interrupts him. Garrett explains that it's to make it easier for others to know who to ask about the power shortage, but John refuses to wear the white safety helmet that goes with it, so his professional uniform conflicts with his messy black hair.
   
   Garrett questions Fredrick on how Kinn knows about _not just the power shortage_, but also that it was a _nuclear power plant_ that went offline, and ends up taking Fredrick into an adjacent room to remind him of why they're trying to keep it a secret from the rest of the Stronghold.
   
   John quickly asks Kinn if he works at the SST HQ because of his own curiosity, since he himself is there for the first time and wasn't sure if Kinn actually worked there, having been brought in that morning to help with the power shortage - John goes on to what he was first going to say, as indicated by his thought-out explanation:
   
   John was the Plant Manager of Perksons Power Plant, a Thorium-based nuclear power plant that helped power Stronghold Fox, which seemed to have gone offline the previous night, but can be restarted using its backup systems to restore its supply of power - After a brief pause of silence, John points out that he needs a question from Kinn to go off of.
   
   Kinn asks about how they'll "fix" the Stronghold's power plant, John clarifies that the power plant isn't _for the Stronghold_ - It was built years prior to begin with, but happened to service the area it's in - and that all they know is it stopped supplying power. In John's opinion...
   
   
   likely caused by damage that made it go into an automatic shutdown since it hadn't had maintenance for the past 5 years... 
   
   John also points out that the way Kinn is phrasing it suggests it can simply be repaired, which is practically impossible given the situation they're in, but the power plant has backup systems it can switch over to for such an emergency, which is doable with John's help, as he was the former manager of Perksons Power Plant.
   
   Kinn ponders for a bit, then asks about the Stronghold's _own power supply_, because it's meant to be a place for people to hold out from the threat of Krushers - A detail Kinn knew about from an old school field trip to one of the first Strongholds when they started getting built, which John is taken aback by, comparing it to visiting a Doomsday Bunker, and wonders just how desensitized people _were_ to Krushers.
   
   Kinn points out that Krushers have been around ever since he was 7, so people were accustomed to the existence of Krushers and their nature, but Kinn's aware that visiting a Stronghold for a school field trip was certainly strange.
   
   Going back to Kinn's question, John says that the Stronghold _does have generators for power_, however - John pauses to choose his words carefully - _"the power they supply is insufficient to balance out the levels of power consumption in the long term"_. Fredrick points out the complexity in John's explanation, rather the casual but blunt explanation he got from John, who compared the Stronghold's generators to _"nothing more than emergency generators"_, because _"the people who built the stronghold started slacking off after 12 years"_.
   
   John starts ridiculing Fredrick on how he's terrible at keeping secrets, and asks Garrett if they can tell Fredrick nothing so he _"doesn't leak the power shortage to the entire stronghold"_ - Garrett, now somewhat annoyed, focuses John's attention back on the expedition they're planning to _Perksons Power Plant - Stronghold Fox's main source of power_.
   
   Kinn looks around, then asks where Ruiz is - being the only SST leader Kinn is familiar with, since they're sent out on expeditions the most often - Fredrick tells Kinn that Ruiz and his squad left on an expedition the other day, so Garrett - the leader of SST 2, a team 2nd best to Ruiz's - took charge in Ruiz's place.
   
   Fredrick also mentions that SST 1 would've stayed if the weather hadn't changed so drastically from clear skies to a fierce storm, but treats it like it was just unlucky.
   
   Fredrick asks about the expedition Garrett had mentioned, and Kinn chooses to stay and listen, telling Garrett that he only starts work an hour later when Garrett questions him about it.
   
   John explains that Stronghold Fox's practically only source of power is Perksons Power Plant, a Thorium-based nuclear power plant that was left online for the past 5 years, but was advanced enough to operate on its own, most likely only possible because of the very minimal level it needed to run at - only having to power the Stronghold, rather than the local area of 3 million that it was designed for.
   
   Just going by the stronghold's mere 30,000 residents alone, even in the worst case scenario of a projected 3 years worth of nuclear fuel, the power plant could easily for last decades with a very large room for error.
   
   It's not unthinkable that the power plant's reactors - _John states it has 3 reactor units, though any one of which can sustain the stronghold on its own_ - went into automatic emergency shutdowns from the cultivation of many different malfunctions that couldn't be remedied, or had important components vital to operating the reactors damaged.
   
   The former might've happened with the last reactor unit, since there was a storm raging in the area at the time the plant stopped supplying power, though it was designed to withstand such natural elements. To be specific, it had two lightning rods, however they could've failed at some point, as again, _there wasn't any maintenance for 5 years_.
   
   Kinn asks about the possibility of Krushers damaging the power plant, but John is unsure about that - The power plant located on the other side of city, in the southern outskirts of Chinelo, but most structural damage caused by Krushers is collateral. Even in the hard-hit highly populated areas of Chinelo, almost all buildings were left standing, and any areas that weren't immediately accessible to Krushers often went entirely untouched.
   
   Perksons Power Plant was also rather large, with only 200 to 300 people on site at any given time who were all prepared for emergency evacuations, and in John's opinion, even if the storm the previous night were to have gotten Krushers close enough to the power plant to potentially damage it, their attacks would've still targeted the rain, which might not even break through the plant's walls which were built to withstand earthquakes and tornadoes.
   
   John thinks the most Krushers could've done to the power plant is take out the power lines that exported power, but even that seems unlikely because there's still plenty of them standing just around the stronghold itself.
   
   
   
   There isn't anymore information John can provide without going off of hunches, but they are planning on sending a drone out to investigate.
   
   Once John stops speaking, Kinn asks if the stronghold has its own stable power supply, as it's meant to be _a place for people to hold out from the threat of Krushers_.
   
   However, that's apparently not that case, and John mentions that the stronghold's construction was lackluster, and it's location was merely the most convenient since _**civilian residences** weren't allowed **within 20km of the frontlines**_, but only impacted Chinelo's northern outskirts, leaving most of the city unaffected, so some of those northern outskirts were just repurposed into the stronghold, skipping out on a lot of the standard long term survival components.
   
   John starts going off on a tangent about how people stopped considering Krushers a threat after 12 years to take the improper emergency preparations seriously, or even the lack of effective weaponry against them, but he stops himself midway.
   
   Fredrick breaks the silence by asking Garrett what their strategy is to resolve the power shortage, which Garrett can't say for sure, but each reactor has backup systems that they should be able to switch over to, and only a couple people are needed provided they follow very specific instructions from John - The backup systems can even switch between reactors, as long as their primary reactor is inactive.
   
   Stronghold Fox's power can last a few days on backup generators, but they'll send out an expedition to the power plant before then, but due to a personnel shortage, the team will consist of members from different SSTs.
   
   Garrett will be the squad leader, John has to go along to offer assistance, and as Garrett considers who else to take with them, Martin from SST 3 overhears the conversation and offers to go, having worked as a surgeon, but gained experience out in the field during the past 5 years.
   
  _--SST 6--_ 
  
  Just as Kinn is about to leave, he remembers someone that could help in the expedition to Perksons Power Plant, who is not only knowledgeable about Krushers, but was also one of the first people to fight against them, who he's about to inform Garrett of - Suddenly, we cut to an old man with gray hair, and a 3 year old boy in his lap, and he seems to be telling the boy a story, until he describes something, in plural, as "really big" and "got a bunch of eyes".
  
  A younger man passing by overhears this, faintly exclaiming, _"What the hell?"_, in English, which is apparently "Roxian" pointed out by the old man when the young man barges in to confront him.
  
  _SCENE: GAVIS_
   We see Trey: He's white, he's missing his left forearm with faint scars on his left elbow suggesting he lost it in an accident, he has messy brown hair that sticks upwards, and he's wearing a red checker-board shirt, blue jeans with some rips and tears, and a sliver pearl necklace with a small circular container attached to it _(containing the ashes of his dead wife.)_
   
   Trey confronts the old man - Gavis, about what he's telling Gabriel, also in English, which Gavis points out to Gabriel as being in Roxian, even going to the length of calling Trey _"Dad"_.
   
   Trey explains he doesn't want Gabriel to know about Krushers, but Gabriel somehow learned about them the previous night, so Trey wants to know if Gavis had anything to do with it. Gavis tries to follow along, but he tells Trey to speak in Rossgivian, joking that the bits of Roxian he's picked up from Trey over the years doesn't make him fluent, before saying they can keep the subject vague _(so Gabriel doesn't understand it.)_
   
   Now speaking in Rossgivian, Trey repeats his question, to which Gavis explains that Gabriel asked him about something with a noticeably similar description to Krushers, and was trying to confirm if he _was_ talking about Krushers, and makes it clear that he hadn't told Gabriel about Krushers before, or anything related to them besides how dangerous the area outside the Stronghold is _(an excuse both Trey and Gavis decided on to avoid potential questions when Gabriel was born.)_
   
   
   Gabriel is white, has short brown hair, and he's wearing a red T-shirt, and starry blue pajamas.
   
   Gavis asks Trey if he thinks he's telling Gabriel about 'his arm', because he isn't, and is just telling Gabriel about 'the outside of this place'. Still, Trey doesn't want Gabriel to know about it as he's only three, and has never been outside the Stronghold. _For whatever reason, Trey thought Gavis already told Gabriel about 'the outside'_, so he's somewhat surprised when Gavis swears he hasn't.
   
   We hear a doorbell, which Gavis assumes is Kinn as he frequently comes over to visit Gabriel.
   
   Trey answers the door, and we see that Kinn brought Garrett with him, as he's commenting about a tunnel shortcut they took to get there that he himself never knew about. Garrett has no clue as to why Kinn brought him there - There's a large nameplate on the front door that clearly tells them they've got the wrong person - so he's flabbergasted when he sees that Gavis just happened to be in that exact apartment.
   
   Gavis jokingly asks Garrett if he's there to offer him a promotion, but Garrett points out that Gavis is 50 years old, so he wouldn't be suitable to take on risker expeditions. Kinn wonders if Garrett is declining the offer to bring Gavis along, but Garrett asks Trey if there's somewhere that he can speak to Gavis privately - Trey opens the door of what seemed to be another room, but ends up being a walk-in closet, which Garrett initially takes as a joke until Kinn offers to stay outside.
   
   While Garrett and Gavis are in the closet, Kinn helps Trey clean up a mess of toys Gabriel created, and after Gabriel dozes off, Trey asks Kinn if he told Gabriel about Krushers, but he hasn't, and finds it odd that Trey thought he did or even _would_.

   Trey explains that Gabriel commented about something that sounded similar to a Krusher, but after pondering to himself, disregards it, figuring it was something natural that Gabriel simply doesn't know how to explain.
   
   Garrett and Gavis leave the closet, with Gavis choosing to go on the expedition after very little convincing from Garrett, commenting on the difficulty for Garrett to find someone else due to the personnel shortage.
   
   Garrett asks Kinn if there's somewhere for him to be, and Kinn, after realising what time it was, quickly runs off.
  
  After Gavis is recruited into SST 6, we're introduced to Don, the sole survivor of SST 5, which was ambushed and almost entirely killed by Krushers during an expedition 2 years prior.
  
  Using a drone, John notes that one of the power plant's cooling towers collapsed into the main building, where Unit 1's coolant piping was located, most likely rupturing them - It's hard to say because the drone barely has enough battery life for a round trip, only able to take a series of photos before needing to return.
  
  There's no signs of damage for Unit 2 or 3 (though wasn't the focus of the drone) which could've gone offline due to malfunctions, so SST 6 will try restarting Unit 1 using its backup systems.
  
  _SCENE: DON_
   We see Don in a dark apartment, and the only light comes through a window which has its blinds slightly open.
   
   Don has medium brown skin, brown hair, and he's wearing a brown coat, black pants, and a white T-shirt. He reflects on his last expedition 2 years ago: Him and the rest of SST 5 were out scavenging, and while travelling though a raised greenery, Don fell down a drop onto a floor below where a railing detached at some point, which he mistook for another route.
   
   Don broke his leg from the fall, forcing SST 5 to return back to the stronghold, but on their way back, they came face to face with a Krusher. The Krusher's body is cast in darkness, and we cut right back to Don in his apartment, as he's grasping a pocket knife in his right hand.
   
   Fredrick opens the front door to check on Don, who quickly puts the pocket knife away in his pocket, but Fredrick still saw it, and quietly leaves Don to himself.
   
   Eventually, Don goes to the SST HQ where we see SST 6 planning out their expedition. Don still works with the SSTs, but doesn't go on any expeditions anymore, instead choosing to help on the backend. Don goes out onto the rooftop for a smoke, but causes him breathing problems, so he throws the cig away off the side of the roof.
   
   Don looks out into the distance, stepping up onto the railing - This worries Fredrick, who's watching Don from back in the stairwell, but went he runs off, Don notices that someone was watching him.
   
   
   
   --_rough ideas below, Don is shown to have experienced great trauma, so it shouldn't go nearly this smoothly, and Don bringing up Kinn so that Fredrick goes along to accompany him could also go the other way around._
   
   But once Don hears about the stronghold's power shortage, after debating on whether or not to help on the expedition, he eventually chooses to join SST 6.
   
   At some point, Don brings up Kinn, a University graduate in Engineering - made obvious by Kinn's jacket which he always wears - and points out that he could help out with any structural damage the power plant endured.
  
  After deciding on the members of SST 6: Garrett, Gavis, Don, Kinn, Fredrick, Marcus, and John. They begin their training for the expedition in 3 days - March 5th - since the emergency generators can only last until the 7th before they need to start cutting back on power usage, which would force them to reveal the power shortage to the rest of the Stronghold.
  
  
  Sometime during the night of March 3rd, a man wearing a dark jacket and a headlamp, with a small bag of equipment, an empty duffel bag, a grappling hook, and a makeshift archer bow sneaks off to the Stronghold's tall perimeter wall, walking along it until he locates a small spraypainted marker.
  
  With the help of his headlamp, he uses the archer bow to launch the grappling up and over the wall, and drags its rope back until the hook catches onto a top lip on the perimeter walls, allowing the man to climb up, then repel down the wall, leaving his bow at the top so he doesn't have to carry it around.
  
  The man sets out, utilizing the many narrow alleyways and pedestrian areas in Chinelo to protect himself from Krushers, until he reaches an apartment building, where he has broken into and looted a number of its apartments already, having already gone through the bottom floor, and begins to clear out the couple remaining apartments on the 2nd floor.
  
  He loots various commercial products, especially unique non-essential items that wouldn't have been stored in the Stronghold, and fills up the duffel bag right he gets to the last few apartments on the 2nd floor.
  
  He begins making his way back to the Stronghold, where he intends to sell them for the Stronghold's personal currency, Tokens, as the items he collects are at best rarely, but typically aren't brought back by the SSTs from expeditions.
  
  However, he suddenly hears the sound of an approaching Krusher, so he quickly runs back into the safety of a nearby narrow alleyway, planning to take a different route in order to get past it.
  
  _--EXPEDITION--_
  
  On March 4th, SST 6 leaves on their expedition to the Perksons Power Plant - It's Kinn and Fredrick's first time leaving Stronghold Fox in 5 years.
  
  _SCENE: THE EXPEDITION_
   When leaving the Stronghold, SST 6 has to pretend they're on a scouting mission when confronted by onlookers, as they haven't disclosed the power shortage outside of HQ.
   
   We hear the whirring of 3 drones above, which acts a signal for them to start the expedition, since they're controlled by people at HQ who'll look out for Krushers from above, and can communicate with Garrett and Gavis via radio.
   
   Gavis mentions that the first kilometer out from the stronghold is practically free of Krushers because of all the barriers the SSTs have set up over the years, but even in the rest of Chinelo, there's only a couple of Krushers left, which shouldn't pose much trouble if they stick to the narrow passageways.
  
  _SCENE: ROSSGIVO FLAG_
   As SST 6 makes their way through the western areas of Chinelo to reach Perksons Power Plant, they're forced to take a detour after a Krusher is discovered up ahead near their intended route by one of the 2 scout drones, specifically _Drone-Guy_.
   
   Strangely, it's the 3th Krusher SST 6 had encountered during the expedition, even though there only an estimated 4 Krushers left in Chinelo for the past few months, which Drone-Guy points out to the other drone operators, accidently transmitting it over the radio which Gavis manages to hear, so Gavis mentions that the storm a couple days prior could've likely lured those Krushers with it and put them on a similar trajectory, since the storm had moved out of Chinelo towards the west.
   
   
   they can't determine _the exact number of Krushers left_ because of their near _identical appearances_, though admits that compared to the usual 1 or 2 Krushers Gavis typically sees lingering around the same areas from his prior expeditions, lining up rather well with the estimated 5 Krushers left in Chinelo, he still finds it odd that they encountered 4 Krushers before they've even reached the power plant _(Gavis is about to bring up the storm from a few days prior having possibly lured the Krushers to around the same trajectory their planned route to the power plant took as the storm left the area, but he gets cut off by Garrett before he considers it further.)_
   
   Garrett ceases this (perspective-wise) irrelevant radio chatter by reminding them of the battery life it consumes from the _Radio Drone_ - 1 of 4 drones dedicated to relaying radio commutations between SSTs and HQ in Stronghold Fox during local expeditions, which stays above an SST throughout an expedition, however its receivers and relays used to maintain radio contact is entirely custom-fitted, and consumes additional power from the drone's battery to operate.
   
   All 3 drones accompanying SST 6 have enough battery life _(max range of 36km)_ for a roundtrip to Perksons Power Plant _(24km roundtrip)_, however they'll remain idle at the power plant since the Radio Drone uses the additional battery life to power its radio equipment, which is largely meant to inform SSTs of any dangers and/or obstacles they can't see _(unless Garrett, being the Squad Leader, forcibly powers it up remotely using a small custom switch in case of an emergency)_, and the 2 other drones are used for scouting ahead so they'll also remain idle until SST 6 starts their return trip to Stronghold Fox.
   
   
   To best avoid Krushers, most SST routes go through pedestrianized areas, alleyways, buildings, and/or closed-off outdoor areas where Krushers either cannot enter or are significantly impeded when doing so, such as surrounding structures obstructing their movement.
   
   SSTs need to take caution when moving across streets, roads, or any open areas such as plazas where Krushers can move much more freely, which often leads to them being bypassed/moved around unless it's absolutely necessary, or if the Squad Leader determines it to be safe to quickly cut across, either to save time, or if any alternative routes aren't viable or isn't immediately identifiable.
   
   Although SST 6 has 3 inexperienced first-timers, Garrett and Gavis both agree on cutting across a wide 6-lane road then moving through a nearby outdoor park on the other side surrounded by small-rise buildings on all sides, except for a sidewalk entrance that connects it to an adjacent parking lot _(which is already visible from SST 6's position in a nearby alleyway)_, then cutting through one of the buildings along the south side of the park.
   
   Garrett informs HQ of their plan via radio, who accepts it, and each scout drone then flies over to one of two intersections that are on either end of that stretch of road, covering the blind spots they create for SST 6 to avoid the risk of a Krusher suddenly popping out from around a corner.
   
   One of the intersections is an overpass highway intersection that appears to have most likely had its south exit blown apart by the military during the fall of Chinelo in an attempt to slow the advance of Krushers, which serves as an 8km marker from the stronghold, a detail Drone-Guy later relays back to SST 6.
   
   After the scouts drones reach the intersections, with no signs of Krushers, the HQ gives Garrett an all clear, and Garrett tells SST 6 to move across the road, causing them to sprint across the road except for Kinn and Fredrick who get caught off-guard by the others' reactions, so Garrett quickly ushers them across by telling them that Krushers can easily move over 100km per hour on the roads and highway because of their wide, flat surfaces, and are also easily able to push aside any cars, trucks, even semi-trucks that are in their way.
   
   After Kinn and Fredrick make it across, Garrett adds on that the long lengths of roads/highways can make Krushers far down them hard to immediately notice without it necessarily leading to significant hinderance in their movement if they tried crushing a person they've noticed by moving directly towards them.
   
   
   
   
   
   But as SST 6 moves across the 6-lane road, it quickly becomes obvious that a Krusher had at one point made its way into the park through the same means: A sidewalk ramp meant to allow access for emergency vehicles into the park had been severely damaged, with the remains of a sign warning of a $500 violation fine being the main indicator of what it was; The (2nd) floor of the skywalk that would've been above the sidewalk entrance was reduced to rubble with only its upper (3rd) floor remaining; An entire portion spanning two floors on the southern side of a building the skywalk connected to, was completely demolished with most of its rubble strewn around near the entrance inside the park, with the additional rubble of the two floors above it in its place that although would've been too high for a (Wall) Krusher to reach, had most likely been the result of the absence of supports from any floors below them soon afterwards.
   
   
   
   Besides that, there's not much damage to the park itself other than a long toppled over pole in the centre, and minor scarring in the terrain the Krusher caused while passing through, but it's been long enough that it's more of a dip in terrain with grass already regrowing inside it.
   
   With how uniform the scarring is, along with the relatively minor damage, SST 6 presumes only one Krusher ever passed through the park. As SST 6 is passing through the park, Gavis quickly checks what the pole was from his own curiosity, and immediately figures out it was a flagpole after finding a rope that ran along the length of it, and tattered fabric remnants of the flag, especially by its unique colour palette: _Red, White, Black, and a bit of Yellow._
   
   Gavis identifies it as the (Rossgivo) flag, which is apparently the fifth time Gavis came across a place where Krushers only damaged the flag, so he makes a joke about Krushers secretly having a higher level of intelligence, and that they're targeting Rossgivo flags purely out of spite.
   
   However, Fredrick points out that Gavis himself said Krushers merely target anything that moves, and flags can be easily moved by a small breeze, so it's reasonable that flags are more frequently damaged by Krushers; Kinn is aware that a lack of additional damage may seem unusual, but he doesn't know how that implies Krushers have a higher intelligence.
   
   Gavis, now somewhat disappointed by the others lack of understanding, asks Garrett - the 2nd oldest member of SST 6, at 37 years old - if he understands the joke. Garrett ponders for a bit, then asks if it means Krushers hate peace _(because the flag symbolises a transition into peace)_, since their current circumstance certainly aren't peaceful in the slightest, and Garrett assumed it meant any instances were only the flag was damaged were Krushers trying to prove that point.
   
   Gavis accepts this as being close enough to what his joke was about, but Kinn asks him what it was supposed to mean. Gavis points out that it has to do with the flag's symbolism, but gets caught off guard when Kinn says he doesn't know what it means, something that was apparently commonplace when Gavis was in high school, so he ends up explaining the symbolism behind the Rossgivo Flag:
   
   A black triangle on the left with its tip in the centre, a white and red bi-colour (top and bottom) taking up the leftover space, and a yellow star in the centre marking the _1950 civilian revolution_.
   
   The black represents Rossgivo's long history of violent wars that expanded its territory, the white represents peace, the red represents power and strength, and the yellow star marking the 1950 civilian revolution where Rossgivo's government and military was organized into a democratic nation, bringing an end to its history of war and territorial conquering.
   
  _SCENE: FREDERICK'S DEATH_
   Serves as the first appearance of a Krusher, how they kill people, and gives a similar feeling of shock by the agonizing death of who seemed to be one of the main characters.
  
  _--AFTERMATH--_
  
  We finally once again see SST 1 as they return to Chinelo during the dusk of March 6th, their clothes covered with dirt and carrying a smaller load in their hiking backpacks compared to when they left on their expedition, all of whom have survived however they converse with one another just before they reach Stronghold Fox, in a manner that indicates they're hiding something they discovered during the expedition which Ruiz is trying to keep under wraps until they figure out what they should do from that point onward.
  
  As SST 1 retraces its steps through Chinelo, Ruiz contacts SST HQ over the radio to announce their return to the Stronghold, expecting to get a typical welcoming response, but Ruiz instead receives news of a significant development that occurred in the Stronghold while they were away, however the other person over the radio decides that SST 1 should be informed of it in person and so doesn't expand on what that development was.
  
  When SST 1 reenters the Stronghold, Gavis pulls them aside into a private room within SST HQ to inform them about the Stronghold's ongoing lack of a stable power supply, as the last online reactor in Perksons Power Plant had shutdown the night after SST 1 left on their expedition.
  
  A temporary SST was formed and had left that morning to try to restart those reactors, due to the Stronghold's dangerously low power reserves that will likely only last a few more days, but the SST encountered a stray Krusher along the way, which killed a young SST worker who had volunteered to assist on the expedition, forcing the SST to retreat back to the Stronghold.
  
  Gavis can only think of two options: Either address the power shortage to the rest of the Stronghold's residents so that it can be conserved but could lead to widespread panic, or attempt to restart the power plant's reactors again, which
  
  
  
  
  Once SST 6 makes it back to the stronghold, they reveal the news of Fredrick's death to the people at HQ, who then make preparations for SST 1 - who'll be returning to the stronghold later that evening if they failed to reach the frontlines - to receive Fredrick's remains if they're able to do so without encountering the same Krusher that killed Fredrick as it's likely still nearby.
  
  As Ruiz's squad returns to the stronghold, it's clear they have bad news which they're hesitant to share to the others, to the point of fabricating parts of their expedition to avoid doing so. Ruiz is carrying a reddish-stained garbage bag that contains several wet, squishy sounding objects, heavily implied to be Frederick's remains when Ruiz refers to it as 'additional bad news'.
  
  After Frederick's funeral finishes, it's revealed that the stronghold's power shortage has been disclosed, with everyone now having to limit their power usage. Despite the stronghold having enough power stored in batteries to have kept it under wraps for 2 more days, it was decided that relying on a 2nd expedition for SST 6 would be too risky, and that SST 1 would instead take charge of the 2nd expedition once they returned.
  
  Trey lashes out at SST 6 after mistaking the power shortage for an outage, since there's multiple people in intensive medical care who could die because of it - similar to how his wife Amelia died from untreated cancer - but Gavis calms him down after clarifying it to be a power shortage, and that medical facilities would be prioritized.

  _SCENE: TRAC-A-NATOR_
   Shortly after Fredrick's funeral finishes, with Kinn still silently sitting in the 'hall', now alone as the Sun begins to set, we hear the loud thud of a Wall getting itself trapped in the trench traps at the entrance of Stronghold Fox, breaking one of its wooden footbridges from its sheer weight. 
   
   Kinn, along with nearby SST members and regular residents, rush over and gather around the Krusher: Its bottom half is stuck in the trenches, with its bottom row of eyes barely poking out above it, and the walls of the trench surrounding it are severely damaged, with the Krusher having crashed into it at such an immense force, it created large deep cracks in the ground.
   
   For whatever reason, the large chain-link gate at the stronghold's entrance had been left open, which Gavis _(who had just arrived, wondering what all the commotion was about)_, jokes about as being an invitation to let any stray rodents in, but mentions that it should be left closed for that reason even if it's entirely useless against the brunt of a Krusher, in a bit more of a serious tone; Further adding to the element of realism from the mention of rodents, and it's used immediately after to further emphasis how lackluster Stronghold Fox's construction was.  
   
   We then see that the Krusher's body would've been too wide to fit through the narrow passages created by the line of spaced-out, tall thick concrete pillars surrounding a small area outside the entrance, and are just behind the trenches _(These were explained in an earlier scene by Gavis as being a 2nd row of defense which are strong enough to resist the full brunt of a Wall Krusher, probably right as SST 6 is about to leave on their expedition since I haven't drafted it yet.)_
   
   Kinn is familiar enough with Fredrick's work to know that any Krushers that get caught in the trenches are neutralized using a large anti-Krusher weapon _(having heard about the procedure from Fredrick a few years back as it was a common occurrence)_, which he promptly brings up to answer some of the regular residents questions about what to do with the Krusher, but Kinn doesn't know the exact details or how it's actually done, so Gavis explains it instead.
   
   Gavis mentions that although _they do have anti-Krusher weapons_, they're military personnel-use weaponry that require unique ammo which the Stronghold has a limited supply of, so instead they use a weapon Gavis built himself from his own knowledge of Krushers and expertise in Engineering _(which he has diploma in, from 2049 when he graduated Nicole University.)_
   
   However, Gavis goes off on an unnecessarily long monologue to bring up what anti-Krusher weapon is used to neutralize Krushers caught in the trench traps, which Garrett can tell right away since had Gavis frequently done so, so Garrett gets straight to the point and tells Kinn to retrieve the tractor in the (SST) garage, which Kinn is understandably confused by with how seemingly unrelated it is to the current topic.
   
   We suddenly cut to an eyecatcher right as Gavis is about to introduce the weapon: It's a tractor modified to hold a tank of compressed air, used to fire a harpoon-like gun attached to the underside of the tractor with the harpoon just ahead of its front bumper; It has the generic sci-fi sounding name, "_Trac-a-nator_", intentionally named as such by Gavis _"because it sounds cool"_; The tractor is only used for transporting the weapon, because according to Gavis, without it, _"nobody would have the balls to go up to a Krusher and use it"_.
   
   This yet again tells us just how accustomed Gavis is to Krushers from his lack of seriousness in describing the anti-Krusher weapon, like if he was forced into it, and the inclusion of quotes implies whoever wrote the document wasn't sure how to make Gavis's answers seem legitimate, and not something random they wrote while drunk.
   
   The Trac-a-nator is a tractor used for transporting the anti-Krusher weapon, or _"spear cannon"_, located on the underside of the tractor, with its spear pointing out ahead of the tractor. It is used to neutralize immobilized Krushers _(specifically caught in Stronghold Fox's trench traps)_, which although doesn't mean it _cannot_ neutralize mobile Krushers, it wasn't something it was ever designed for, which is especially apparent given the tractor's rather slow speed _(20km/h.)_
   
   The spear cannon shoots out its 2 metre long, thin metal spear which is used to pierce a Krusher's brain, and inflict severe trauma to try and kill it before the Krusher's body restoration abilities activate, which practically occurs immediately, with 2 second delay _at most_, and typically activates a little over a second after damage is inflicted to a Krusher's body.
   
   (The specific details about _Krusher Body Restoration_ - its official name - was discovered by scientists many years prior, something Gavis mentions when Kinn asks about the oddly specific details, but Gavis is clueless as to how the data was collected to begin with.)
   
   The spear bypasses a Krusher's highly damage resistant body fluids by shooting through a Krusher's eye, and the linear, fragile, inelastic fleshy 'tubes' that carry the nerves connected between the Krusher's eyes and brain, which it is _just_ small enough to pass through without getting caught against the Krusher's body fluids, as long as the spear cannon is perfectly angled by the Trac-a-nator operator.
   
   By having the spear pierce through a Krusher's eye, and the fleshy tube that connects it to the brain, it's far easier to kill a Krusher because its body fluids are unable protect those areas due to its particular body structure which blocks its own body fluids from reaching them, and the fact its body fluids are a brace against immense force and aren't something that seeps into its body at varying levels of concentration, making them hardly useful to begin with besides potentially damaging or getting the spear stuck if it isn't properly angled.
   
   _(The Krushers' fleshy eye tubes exist so that their body fluids don't rip apart its own nerves)_
   
   
   The spear itself _(plus the cable connected to the other end of it)_ also mostly blocks a Krusher's body reconstruction since they'd be in the way, and it cannot be pushed out by the Krusher unless it's able to use its body fluids to do so _(Krushers will never intentionally push their body fluids outside their body so it can reenter in a different part of their body, though they can only move their body fluids a couple centimetres outside their body to begin with.)_
   
   
   
   These details are explained by Gavis as he teaches Kinn how to use the Trac-a-nator.
   
   The spear is attached to a long line of cable which can reel it back in if needed.
   
   
   We return from the eyecatcher, and we see Kinn was reading it as a paper document, but in Rossgivian. Kinn lowers the document, revealing the Trac-a-nator, since Gavis wanted to teach Kinn how to use it _(because Kinn's friend, Fredrick, was killed by a Krusher only hours prior.)_
   
   Gavis explains how the weapon works to Kinn: The only way to kill a Krusher is to destroy its brain, but because of their "restorable bodies" _(which Gavis demonstrates by slicing out a portion of the Krusher's eye with a knife)_ any inflicted damage done it will be reversed unless its brain is severely damaged or destroyed _(Gavis explains, as the sliced out portion of the Krusher's eye pulls apart piece by piece and reassembles itself back into it's original state, as if the injury never occurred at all.)_
   
   
   However, there's the additional factor of a Krusher's armor, in the form of body fluids which resemble blood _(something Kinn apparently mistaken it for, despite it not transporting any nutrients, and baffled Gavis because Krushers clearly have no way of taking in any.)_ After that tangent by Gavis, he explains that a Krusher's armor protects their outer skin by clumping it together in areas where it senses danger, which it does by freely manipulating it in seemingly physics-defying manners within their (mostly) hollow bodies.
   
   Suddenly, Kinn stops Gavis and asks him to clarify what he just said, because Kinn had assumed that Krushers had a "tangled mess of veins" within their bodies, and that they merely hadn't uncovered why Krushers could freely manipulate their blood, _but not in the most literal sense_.
   
   Since a Krusher's eyes have nerves which connect back to its brain through fragile, inelastic, linear fleshy 'tubes', it cannot be protected by the armor, making their eyes _major weakpoints_ as they're the simplest way to damage the brain.
   
   Initially, when Krushers had first appeared, Tanks were the only mass-deployable means to fight against them because they could inadvertently penetrate the brain through shrapnel, but simply pulling out a chunk of the brain can be more than enough, which is what the Trac-a-nator does using its harpoon-like gun.

  Ruiz tells Gavis in a private room about the lack of any radio frequencies across Rossgivo, the ruined frontlines they discovered 55km south of the stronghold, along with the already aging ruins of Rossgivo beyond them. We only see Gavis's initial wide-eyed reaction to what Ruiz tells him, though it's heavily implied Ruiz told Gavis about these things in the next episode, when Trey tells Ruiz he already knew about the information from Gavis _(who had presumably went off immediately afterwards, since the next scene starts with the fall of Stronghold Fox.)_
  
  _--ATTACK--_
  
  We see the shadowy body of a Slammer slowly lumbering towards the perimeter wall of the Stronghold Fox, raising high up into the air by at least 12 metres judging by the number of floors of a 6-storey glass office building next to the Slammer that it reaches above.
  
  The Slammer digs deep into the ground as it raises itself into the air, along the muffled sound of several large impacts from inside the Slammer, one after the other in a series of succession which gradually gets a bit less intensive as it raises higher up into the air, before it then proceeds to slam down harshly on the next stretch of ground, creating deep cracks as it continues moving towards Stronghold Fox.
  
  During the fall of Stronghold Fox, a few SST HQ workers, whom were formerly part of Division 40, attempt to use an Anti-Krusher cannon to kill one of 30 Krushers that are now rampaging throughout the stronghold, all while the Slammer continues to create more breaches in the stronghold's perimeter wall.
  
  The people using the Anti-Krusher cannon arbitrary fire its spear towards a Krusher's eye located in the middle row, with its trajectory pointing upward though it clearly wouldn't go anywhere near the Krusher's brain, however the spear misses the eye anyway and punctures into the skin next to it.
  
  The Krusher's body fluids initially weren't located where the spear had punctured, which allowed the spear to do so despite only being designed to puncture the soft fragile substance of a Krusher's eye.
  
  However the Krusher's body fluids then moved to where the spear punctured and wrapped around it, preventing the spear from being retracted, so the explosive ammo that would've normally been launched into a Krusher's eye instead exploded by the spear upon making contact with the Krusher's outer skin, and hardly did any damage due to its body fluids beside blowing apart the nearby eye _(which the Krusher quickly restored)_, and severing the cable that attached to the spear, practically rendering the weapon unusable.
  
  The people who were operating the cannon were then all killed by another Krusher who attacked them on their left flank, since they were all focusing on killing the first Krusher rather than their surroundings. All of this shows how the Anti-Krusher cannon works, that it's difficult to operate, and wouldn't be an automatic solution to kill off Krushers.
  
**--EPISODE 2: OLD ROSSGIVO**
  [[EP2 Production]]
  
  **Focuses on the original day-to-day lives of the main cast, helping to explain their characters and personal goals, alongside the nation of Rossgivo, and the gradual shift in perception of Krushers from their first appearance to the Fall of Chinelo, as more information was uncovered regarding the GCOs over 15 years.**
  
  The episode opens with Ruiz Kurnell, aged 3 sometime after Christmas in 2049 - the year shown by a nearby calendar - saying goodbye to his dad as he's about to leave their family's apartment to head back out on deployment to a Rossgivian military base.
  
  Ruiz's dad explains to his son that he isn't staying for New Years, but that it was more important to make it back for Christmas, and promises to return in time for Ruiz's 4th birthday coming up later in February.
  
  As Ruiz's dad kisses his wife goodbye, she expresses her concern about his constant military 'deployment', despite Rossgivo's lack of involvement in warfare for over a century, and wants her husband to find a more practical occupation where he can be closer to his son.
  
  Ruiz's dad reminds his wife that his military work was always supposed to be temporary in order to support their family, after he was laid off a year prior but wasn't been able to find an alterative position for the following few weeks, though he clearly takes his wife's concern into consideration as he leaves the apartment to head out to a military base in Northeastern Rossgivo where he's being stationed for 4 weeks.
  
  After Ruiz's dad closes the apartment door, there's a brief title card restating the episode title, before cutting to a similar shot set a few weeks later of someone closing a locker after they've put away their company uniform.
  
  It's just past Midnight on _January 14th, 2050_ and in Northeastern Rossgivo, a blond male worker in his early 20s sets up for his first shift, as another older worker from the previous shift is about to leave for the night as shown by their casual clothing, while the younger worker is wearing a light green full body uniform and cap with a company logo.
  
  The setting is a small security structure designed to accommodate a couple employees at once during regular operations, located along an entrance road that leads into company-owned forested campgrounds, but are currently closed for the winter, with only a single worker manning each station per shift as indicated by the station's several barren desks.
  
  One side of the entrance road slightly turns and runs along one side of the station where there's an area presumably used for campground admission, with a control panel beneath the counter which control two road barriers: One just ahead of the admission booth, and a pair located a short distance away from the station which blocks off the road altogether.
  
  The workers are Security Guards for the company campgrounds site, though since rarely anything noteworthy happens whenever it's closed, its hourly wage is currently only slightly above minimum wage - As mentioned by the older worker, who by chance correctly guesses that the younger worker is a college dropout because of their age, and the small level of qualifications it requires that most highschoolers likely wouldn't have, but the fact the younger worker was taking the night shift made the older worker presume that the younger worker wasn't in post secondary education.
  
  
  
  The older worker then remarks on the current date displayed by a wall mounted digital clock near, as its the 100 year anniversary of the _Civilian Revolution_, an event that established the current democratic country of Rossgivo after ousting its old dictatorship, which ravaged the country from war only a couple years prior that left limited resources and food but was divided among the population by social status, further worsened by intensive bombing done on its industrial sector during the war which had gone largely unrecovered.
  
  The older worker mentions these details in a simplified, almost mocking manner, but finds it odd that the day is still being celebrated annually a century later when almost everyone who lived through the old dictatorship is either dead or too young to remember.
  
  The young worker points out that it's a national day of celebration rather than something only those older generations do, but the older worker brushes it off as they're more concerned about getting back home, though not before reminding the younger worker as they're heading out the door about a timetable for when he's supposed to call in to report anything unusual, since it's his first shift on the job.
  
  Afterwards, we see the first Krusher encounter occur near one of the campgrounds, as well as foreshadowing for how Krushers are created through the campground's unusual damage.
  
  
  
  
  A few hours into the young worker's shift, a powerline leading to Campgrounds C somehow goes down during the calm cloudy night but isn't immediately noticed as it was already deactivated for the winter and so didn't trigger an alarm, which the young worker, being stationed just down the road from the grounds, sets out in a company vehicle to investigate.
  
  Yet, only as the worker begins to reach Campgrounds C does he notice the powerlines sagging, let alone have any damage until he finds collapsed powerlines at the grounds, but more importantly, a small building apart of the grounds which looked fine during his job orientation a few days prior when he was given a tour of the site, laid utterly destroyed other than for its concrete foundations, as if a bomb went off inside the structure.
  
  But strangely, there's hardly any rubble extending outward from the ruined building, and besides for one of the building's face which has significant rubble, it's as if most of the rubble somehow disappeared, with no spread out debris that the worker would've expected a bomb explosion to leave behind, but there is a large though unusually intact crater in the concrete foundations.
  
  However, such an explosion should've most certainly been audible, and the lack of any obvious or reasonable motives the perpetrators could've had further emphasizes that point.
  
  There's also large several metre wide scar marks in the ground's terrain which trails off into the surrounding woods, leaving behind damaged and collapsed trees in its wake - Krusher Damage.
  
  As the worker goes to investigate the outliner trail, he accidently agitates the distant Krusher which he perceives as something large and red, but as it begins violently crashing through the trees while approaching the campgrounds, the worker quickly decides to flee, going by the assumption that it's a crazed lunatic in a bulldozer.
  
  The worker jumps in the company vehicle, and quickly starts the ignition then does a U-turn to leave the campgrounds, and as he begins making some distance he slowly begins to relax and is about to call in over his radio, when he notices in his rearview mirror that a large flat-sided red mass quickly moving towards the vehicle.
  
  It crashes into the rear of the vehicle, sending it off road and careening into the nearby trees, severely injuring the young worker who only has enough to look up at the alien-like organism of a Krusher, and send out an SOS signal using his radio before the Krusher then crushed the front of the vehicle, cutting to black as it kills the worker almost instantly.
  
  _SCENE: FIRST BLOOD_
   A male college dropout is working the night watch of forested campgrounds in the early hours of _January 14, 2050_ - the 100th year anniversary of _Rossgivo's Civilian Revolution_ that brought an end to the nation's long history of aggressiveness and war, which is casually mentioned by one of the man's coworkers who had just finished their own shift as they're heading out, purely just to mock the fact it's even celebrated _(the 100 year time gap making him desensitized to it.)_
   
   Their uniforms are light green, a hat with the company's logo, and nametags for each employee, the only equipment the man has is a belt with a baton, a flashlight, and a radio used to communicate with the other workers, which can send out a distress signal in an emergency.
   
   The company owns large woodlands in the northeastern most province of Rossgivo, and is a popular location for campgrounds, with guards _(who serve more so as fire lookouts)_ stationed around the woodlands all year round but much less so during off seasons, so the man will be the only person at that guard station for his entire shift.
   
   The man keeps himself occupied with a novel while periodically looking out around the vicinity, just so he isn't literally slacking off for his entire shift.
   
   About 2 hours into the man's shift, at a different guard station manned by 3 workers, where the campgrounds main circuit breakers and other important utility components are located, one of the workers notices that the powerlines to Campgrounds C, which although are inactive during off seasons as are the powerlines for the other campgrounds, were somehow _damaged_ as shown by a red indicator.
   
   The worker asks the other two if those powerlines were recently damaged, assuming that he simply didn't know about it, but they're also just as surprised. There isn't any risk of a forest fire, and the company's office aren't open late in the night, so they report it over the radio, and the dropout reports that he'll go over to investigate _(using one of the company's old Jeeps, briefly considering whether to use his own car, but he didn't want to get dirt on its white paint job.)_
   
   Upon his arrival, he uses his flashlight to inspect the campgrounds: A couple powerlines along the road leading to the area were downed, and the few that were in the relatively small grounds were somehow destroyed, with the powerlines having been torn apart; A central structure mostly made of wood, which was primarily used for indoor gatherings, had somehow almost entirely collapsed and was missing large portions of its concrete foundation; The rest of the grounds was mostly open plots where tents could be pitched and/or RVs could be parked, but deep scars were left in the ground which heavily damaged the area's decorative stone walkways, the nearby trees were partially debarked, with the smaller trees having snapped in half, or entirely uprooted.
   
   The significant damage went well beyond the work of any vandal, and lacked any sort of reasonable explanation, especially the central structure where it looked like an explosion had went off, but would've most definitely been audible, and he didn't see any of the missing debris scattered around the grounds.
   
   As the man tries to think of a way to report it over the radio, he comes across a lone scar which follows along what was a hiking trail connected to the grounds, where the man hears strange noises coming further down the trail, which intrigues him and he looks down the length of it using his flashlight.
   
   Suddenly, there's a loud unnatural crashing noise from down the trail, startling the man who briefly tries to work up the nerve to investigate, first reaching for his radio in order to report it, but there's a second crash which is _much closer_ and sends broken tree branches flying into the man's field of view, causing him to immediately start running back to the Jeep.
   
   The man manages to turn on the Jeep's ignition, but has to do a U-turn or try to drive in reverse, he chooses the U-turn, but being in a state of panic along with the narrow 2-lane dirt road almost makes him accidently drive off the road.
   
   Just as the man finishes the U-turn, something crashes into its rear, launching the Jeep forward which veers off the road. The man remains conscious with minor injuries, but that when he gets a good look at the Krusher, a seemingly otherworldly creature, and as it's about to crush the front half of the Jeep, he manages to send out a distress signal using his radio just before the Krusher kills him almost instantly.
  
  
  It's the morning of _January 15, 2050_ _(as shown by a Calendar in the Commander's office)_, and at a military base in Northern _Rossgivo_ - a fictional country as shown by its unique flag that flies high above the base - the Commander is in his office looking through the number of dull emails he receives everyday, when a letter marked as "URGENT" gets passed through a slot in his door.
  
  The letter came straight from Rossgivo's High Military Command, so he immediately opens it with a sense of seriousness, which visibly increases as he begins reading the letter, but gradually becomes more confused and is in a bit of disbelief after reading through it all.
  
  We cut to the perspective of a regular soldier stationed at the base - a married man with short brown hair named _Louis Kurnell_, his last name is shown by the nametag on his short-sleeved green military uniform, "_Pvt. Kurnell_", while the fellow soldiers in his dorm casually refer to him by his first name, "_Louis_".
  
  Over the base's announcement system, Louis and the rest of his dorm, along with several other dorms, are called down to one of the base's many briefing rooms, despite the fact that it conflicts with many of their schedules though it still takes the highest priority, so many of the soldiers have to drop whatever they're doing at that moment.
  
  The Commander is on the phone, confirming that the military operation which was suddenly ordered that morning out of nowhere was legitimate because of how nonsensical it seems, which even the other person on the line admits to having also wondered, though the fact it managed to reach the base commander through the chain of command must mean it's _somehow_ real.
  
  Soldiers begin filing into the room, one of them asks the Commander about why the briefing wasn't on their schedules, but the Commander explains that the operation suddenly came up that morning out of nowhere, replying in an informal manner as they look over the briefing they had to quickly put together - in the end, the Commander mostly improvises the briefing.
  
  The briefing relates to an urgent military deployment to forested campgrounds located in Northeastern Rossgivo, which the base happens to be the closest to, however there's been an confirmed appearance of an unknown hostile organism within the campgrounds, and has most likely already killed a civilian worker - the soldiers are reasonably baffled by it, but choose to not question it as it's apparently a genuine briefing.
  
  The Commander goes on: The organism's existence was first confirmed by the local police who were originally called to the campgrounds to locate the missing worker, when they encountered the organism along a dirt road to the campgrounds site where the worker had reportedly gone.
  
  The organism, shown by 2 sketches from the police which are displayed on a whiteboard using a ceiling projector in the briefing room, has a large red-skinned slightly rectangular body, with a number of eyes on one side being its only other characteristic, its body is about 6m in width _(going by the police officers' testimonies who both said it was "as wide as the road")_, 4 or 5 metres in height, and is only a couple metres in length.
  
  The organism, despite appearing to not have any form of possible movement, was somehow able to propel its body forward at speeds of at least 70km per hour, and attempted to crash right into the police officers' vehicle, but the officers were able to escape by putting the vehicle in reverse and quickly driving off, which was confirmed by the officers dashcam footage, as well as by other unknown personnel who were sent out the previous night to confirm the organism's existence.
  
  As the Commander begins to explain other aspects of the operation, there's a fading transition to a couple hours later, when Louis goes to make a phone call to check up on his wife and son, whom he hasn't seen since the start of the year when he was stationed at the base.
  
  Louis talks in a cheerful mood, especially to his young son, _Ruiz_, whose 4th birthday is coming up later in February which Louis promises to make it back home for, but Louis tells Ruiz that he'll be busy with a _confidential military operation_ which suddenly came up that morning, and that he and the rest of the taskforce will be deployed sometime later in the afternoon once they've gathered up the necessary equipment _(Louis summarises it into simpler words for Ruiz.)_
  
  Louis doesn't provide any further details of the operation to preserve secrecy, pretending that it's make sure the "bad guys" don't find out about it when he's talking to Ruiz, but admits to his wife that it feels like a training exercise despite it strangely being stated otherwise - a random soldier passing by overhears Louis, and points out that Louis already exposed the operation's existence.
  
  _Louis and the soldier clearly don't know each other_ as they address the other by their last names on their nametags - the soldier is about to say something, but they first confirm that he and Louis are on the same operation by making a reference similar to the briefing that any outsiders wouldn't make any connection between - the soldier makes it clear that he isn't going to report Louis because he has the same perception of the operation that Louis does, regardless of if they don't know each other.
  
  At that moment, Louis, the soldier, and the rest of the operation's taskforce which has a codename-like designation, are then called over to a deployment area in the base over the announcement system, forcing Louis to end his call early which he does in a casual manner.
  
  _SCENE: LOUIS_
   Louis has to use a device resembling an old payphone to make calls at the base, as they aren't allowed to use their personal phones for security reasons, though it's able to connect to his wife's smartphone who taking the call in their apartment's kitchen, using her left shoulder to prop the phone up against her ear as she washes the dishes from breakfast.
  
   One dish is a light blue plastic plate divided in 5 sections, which still has bits of ham and scrambled eggs, clearly being from their young son, who's over in the living room watching the Saturday morning children's tv show, where sunlight streams in through the glass door that leads out onto the apartment's balcony.
  
   They're all white and have brown hair, Louis and Ruiz both have short hair but Louis's hair is neatly combed and has sideburns, while his wife's hair is long and dangly.
   
   While Ruiz's parents make small talk, we cut over to Ruiz as he's watching a scene with two distinct red and blue coloured characters, who both wear samurai style robes, and the Red One, _Hokori_, has a traditional samurai sword stored in a holster tied around his waist.
   
   To make the show feel more kid-like and nostalgic, its animation is in Karva's style which is more stiff but makes up for it with the usage of sound effects, in contrast to the actual story which essentially ignores the Roblox aspect, sticks to human anatomy the best it can without being too distracting, and uses foreign language sounding voice lines _(except Trey, who occasionally gets regular voice lines that serve as reminders of him being Roxian.)_
  
   _(In Episode 5, Ruiz mentions in a conversation about childhoods that the Blue One was his favorite because of his lightning power abilities.)_
  
   The two are in a deep dark cavern which opens up into a large room where long stalactites hang from the ceiling, and although the Blue One is carrying an open-flame lantern for light, it's overshadowed by a pulsing red glow from the other side of the room, which is then shown to be emitting from a glowing red sword resting on a protruding rock as a sort of pedestal - given the sword's careful placement, and the abnormal perfectly flat top of the rock - the Blue One identifies the sword as being the "_Legendary Sword_".
  
   Hokori is greatly fascinated by the Legendary Sword, and so too is Ruiz, having presumably been a reveal set up earlier in the show, and Hokori seems to have some association with the sword though he doesn't appear that he's seen it before.
  
   The Blue One tells the Red One that it's the "_Legendary Sword_", something that was presumably set up earlier in the show given the lack of context for it, and Ruiz loudly expresses how he thinks that it looks cool, which Louis overhears, so Louis asks his wife what show Ruiz is watching.
  
   As Louis's wife does her best to describe the show to her husband, he realises that the show is based off a much older children's story Louis read as a kid, with the exact same title and very similar premises, and he confirms this when he hears that they have the same main character, though there's been a couple noticeable changes likely for the purpose of better marketing and opportunities for toys.
   
   The Blue One explains, in a simple manner that can be understood by children, but essentially: The Legendary Sword has been passed down for generations in the Red One's family, and that the Red One's father was its most recent holder but had passed away the previous month, which is why the Red One is being shown the Legendary Sword - it's an attempt to find a new holder.
   
   The Blue One clarifies that the Red One's 12 siblings will also be shown the Legendary Sword as part of the attempt, so the current occasion doesn't necessarily mean that the Red One will be the next holder, though he is the oldest and most trained swordmen, even if his current skills don't stand a chance against his teacher.
   
   Louis tells his wife that he's about to be deployed on a confidential military operation but doesn't provide any details in an attempt to avoid breaking confidentiality, though he admits that it seems like a mock training exercise that they were accidently given a standard form of briefing for rather than the training form, and Louis clarifies in laymen terms that the standard form is used for actual operation but he doesn't believe it was intentional.
  
   This is further emphasized when a random soldier overhears Louis, who Louis then notices, but the soldier makes it clear that he won't report Louis since he himself has the same impression of the operation as Louis does.
  
   Louis eventually asks to talk to Ruiz, and his wife calls Ruiz over to talk to his dad - Ruiz cheerfully tells his dad about every single small thing he's done since he woke up, then his dad 'asks' Ruiz how old he's turning, to which Ruiz answers saying he's turning 4 in February, which his dad says that he'll be back home for once he finishes a military operation he's about to go off on for what could be the next couple of days.
  
   There's a time-skip 8 days forward, shown as days being marked off on a Calendar one by one, during which there's been no contact from Louis to his family - the longest Louis has gone without doing so, though only by a day longer than last time - but his wife figures that Louis is either on a long operation, or it was completed and he's just occupied with dull work at the base.
   
   However, the former would be questionable even for her considering how unserious Louis was concerning the operation, even if it was a casual conversation, and if it was supposed to be a cover-up, it'd make far more sense to just not mention it at all.
   
   But the latter, which although is more so a plausible excuse Louis's wife thought of rather than a regular thing she's aware of, since Louis isn't allowed to share what happens at the base _(Louis does occasionally share bits of information with his family, but it's either to ease his wife's mind, or to entertain Ruiz to make up for his absence)_, but it makes even less sense especially with that last detail - unless it's to avoid making Ruiz begin to question his dad's absence, though his wife hasn't noticed anything that'd support it.
   
   Soon after, the apartment's doorbell rings, and Louis's wife goes to answer the door where's she greeted by a military man she's never met before, who has a somber expression on his face. The man tells her that her husband, Louis Kurnell, was killed in an accident that occurred at the base where he was stationed, causing her to break down in tears - Ruiz, clueless about the heavy news his mom just received, walks over and begins patting her back to try and comfort her.
   
   There's an announcement over the base's speakers, calling a group with a codename-like designation to a briefing room, which apparently includes Louis as he then says goodbye, before hanging up.
   
   8 days later, Louis's wife receives a message from someone sent by the military, who tells her that her husband, Louis, was killed in an accident during a route military exercise, which leaves her in shock.
   
   6 days later, Louis, alongside many others, has a military funeral, but Ruiz is too young to fully understand what's happening. The following day, the President of Rossgivo delivers a message to the world, revealing the existence of Krushers, which are called Geometric Crusher Organisms, and the creation of an exclusion zone of 50km from the frontlines to protect civilian populations.
  
  The taskforce is deployed to the forested campgrounds but only reach the area around sunset, forcing them to engage the Krusher under orders to kill it while it's still in the campgrounds, and although the company that owns them is already questioning the military's presence, it'd be much easier to brush the incident under the rug afterwards - though, hardly any of the soldiers take the operation seriously, up until they actually encounter the Krusher, only to uncover its body restoration abilities, and highly destructive form of attack.
  
  _SCENE: FIRST ENGAGEMENT_
   Military trucks begin pulling up to the campgrounds during the evening, which is business man of the company sent to the area to provide assistance is reasonably shocked by, especially when he spots a couple tanks with them as well, but a senior soldier consults the man, explaining that they'd identified a threat within the campgrounds which the local police are unequipped to properly dispatch of, which the man is understandably not convinced by, but he's aware that the military wouldn't be deployed for no reason.
   
   A number of soldiers scout ahead all across the campgrounds using Jeeps and Motorbikes while most of the taskforce remains on standby - a heavily armed convoy moves to Campgrounds C where the organism was first spotted, however they find nothing other than the mangled wreck of the company Jeep with its front end crushed inward that the missing civilian worker had used, most likely having sent out the distress signal on his radio just before his death, with hardly any intact remains of his body.
   
   Campgrounds C has remained in mostly the same state _(the Krusher having caused a bit more damage which the soldiers couldn't have known about)_, some soldiers try to go ahead on foot on the damaged hiking trail that the organism seemed to have gone down, but are ordered to fall back until air support arrives, since the convoy's vehicles and tank are unable to move down the hiking trail.
   
   Helicopters arrive and begin scanning the forested woodlands, but are unable to spot any trace of the organism - It's not until about an hour, now under the cover of darkness, that one of the pilots discovers an abnormal trail of collapsed trees which they follow, leading them to where the organism is, which is currently heading towards the direction of Campgrounds A and the main road of the Campgrounds site, where the taskforce is then repositioned accordingly.
   
   On January 15th, 2050 at 20:25, a soldier spots the organism within their field of vision as it tries to make its way towards Campgrounds A, and immediately opens fire on it, followed by the rest of the infantry soon after.
   
   Even with the Krusher's large size, it's still located 30 to 50 metres from the closest soldiers, and the dense number of trees blocks most of their bullets, though many soldiers don't account for bullet spread and merely empty their magazines in the general direction of the organism, but some soldiers that are the closest to it manage to score a good number of hits on the Krusher.
   
   The bullets that do hit easily tear through the organism's body as shown by them striking the trees behind it _(because of its hollow body)_, but after the soldiers reload their rifles, those same bullets merely pelt the organism's skin and fall to the ground, but a shell from a nearby tank rips a hole in its skin as expected _(the Krusher reacted to the punctures of the bullets, and spread out its body fluids across the front side of its body as the soldiers reloaded, but it wasn't nearly enough to resist the impact of a tank shell.)_
   
   Many of the soldiers see the tank shell rip apart the organism's skin, greatly motivating as the organism now seems to be weak against their weaponry, but when another tank shell is fired, the organism easily holds up against the impact, with the large gouge in its body created than less than a minute prior seemingly having already regenerated, convincing many soldiers that the organism is an alien, but are too preoccupied with combat to add onto or denounce it.
   
   The organism begins to gradually fall back, then suddenly propels forward veering to the left, where it runs into the same small ledge in the uneven terrain which had already stopped it beforehand, but the force of the impact heavily damages the ledge cracking it into large chunks of rubble, and startles the soldiers.
   
   The organism starts trying to make its way to a nearby foot trail connected to the campgrounds which creates a large opening between the trees and will make it easier for the organism to reach Campgrounds A - The organism repeatedly slams into the trees in its way, causing them to collapse one by one as the taskforce tries desperately to stop the organism, but the organism mostly gets hindered by the leftover tree trunks which have roots that run deep into the ground, though the nearby tank also hinders it a bit as it fires off tank shells, which occasionally forces the organism to stop and divert its body fluids in order to protect itself.
   
   Eventually, the organism makes it to the foot trail where the tank has now repositioned itself in front of, now firing off shells directly towards the organism preventing it from moving forward for some time, before it then tries to do so anyway, allowing the shell to punch through the organism's skin albeit creating a smaller gouge compared to last time. 
   
   The organism's blown off portions of skin then float up and piece themselves back together into its skin like a puzzle as if nothing ever happened, directly disobeying the laws of physics where it's now fully visible in front of the taskforce.
   
   During that small period of time, the tank's Gunner, _Louis_, spots something located in the bottom centre of the organism's hollow body, likely its brain since - after he fires off another shell - it appears that one of the organism's eyes was connected to it. Another shell is fired as the tank commander quickly thinks over it.
   
   With the next shell loaded, the commander tells Louis to aim down towards its brain, which seems to do less damage than before besides it now heavily wounding its bottom centre eye though it still stops the organism from moving forward, but as the next shell is being loaded, the organism's body suddenly collapses in on itself, with the explosive force of the shell having passed through the bottom eye and the nerve that connected it to its brain, which it then blew apart rather easily as it bypassed its protective body fluids, which begin to flow out of its body.
   
   Unsure if the organism is really dead, Louis goes up to the tank's turret machine gun and fires it off into what's left of the organism's brain to which there's no response. With the operation's objective having now been completed, the head of the taskforce in Campgrounds A reports back to the operation's control area - a number of green tents set up for the operation in the campgrounds main parking lot - the company man, who's now questioning why there was gunfire and explosions going off within the campgrounds, threatens to call the police, which a soldier who's currently holding off the man from barging into the main control tent is utterly confused by, but his attention to something off in the distance past the man.
   
   It's a large rectangular silhouette, and as it gets closer, the nearby lights reveals that it looks exactly the same as the organism that was just killed in the campgrounds; The soldier runs into the tent, shouting at them all to get down, right as the Krusher suddenly tears through and ravages the operation control area.
   
   The company man is thrown across the parking lot by the Krusher and lands in a ditch covered in tall grass, with blood now dripping from his head, but remaining conscious enough to flee from the scene.
   
   It's clear from the Krushers' actions that it surpasses what they're normally capable of, especially the Krusher that attacked the operation control area, which although could've been targeting the company man, it didn't go directly for him as the momentum from its impact didn't carry the man along with the Krusher, instead throwing him in a different direction.
   
   As the taskforce tries to regain radio contact, they're suddenly attacked by yet another Krusher which emerges out from one of the foot trails, and slams into the back of the tank's turret where its ammunition was stored, a compartment that the Krusher crushes inward, causing it all to detonate into the tank's turret, instantly killing its entire crew.
  
  It's now the 22th, and at construction size for a midrise office building in Millow, where 26 year old Marcus is currently working, a fellow multilingual coworker shows him a Roxian video he came across on his phone during their lunch time - It's a 10 minute vlog-style video from a Roxian hiker which Marcus doesn't understand a word of, but the coworker explains that its log of events that lead up to a sudden reveal at the end, which the coworker intentionally leaves vague, but it's been gaining traction in Roxia because of its great VFX and acting.
  
  In reality, it's a retelling of events that led the hiker to discover the existence of Krushers while in Rossgivo, when he decided to tail a military convoy since the military had recently started vacating towns and cities in Northeastern Rossgivo with little to no explanation given.
  
  The video, which was leaked online by one of the man's less tech-savvy relatives, had become popular in Roxia but the language barrier and the fact it was posted on a Roxian site had kept it almost entirely unknown in Rossgivo.
  
  At the same time, Louis's family still hasn't heard back from him, which his wife doesn't think too much of, but she soon learns that her husband had died in a "_workplace accident_" which she struggles to believe.
  
  On the 29th, at a military funeral being held in Louis's honour, the soldier who had overheard Louis speaking to his family, asks a mourning lady who's there with her young son if Louis was her husband, with Ruiz too young and innocent to comprehend what happened at the time.
  
  The soldier tells her that Louis didn't die in a mere workplace accident, but isn't allowed to tell her what really happened, though even if he could he feels that it'd seem disrespectful, even if he swears it's the truth, however he doesn't believe it'll stay a secret for long given the poor public perception it has created during the past 2 weeks.
  
  The following day on January 30, the 34th President of Rossgivo gives an address to the world, revealing the existence of Krushers which suddenly appeared in Northeastern Rossgivo, and that the military has been attempting to contain their spread as their numbers have steadily increased ever since they first appeared on the 14th.
  
  The official name given to Krushers are "_Geometric Crusher Organisms_", or "_GCOs_", which are able to freely manipulate parts of their body, either to forcefully move their bodies at speeds of up to 100km per hour or to protect themselves against weaponry using their highly resistant body fluids, and are able to restore any damaged sections of their body in mere seconds.
  
  However, through the usage of tanks of claymores, an effective method to kill Krushers has been discovered, and the production of specialized personnel weaponry will soon begin in order to more effectively dispatch of the GCOs.
  
  _SCENE: INTERNATIONAL ADDRESS_

**--EPISODE 3: SURVIVAL 301**
  [[EP3 Production]]
  
  **Focuses on survival tactics amidst the constant threat of Krushers, and reveals that the nation of Rossgivo had long since fallen to the Krushers, further emphasized by its capital Nicole being in complete ruin, with its Stronghold Iron Fist having been breached yet didn't seem to have ever been utilized.**
  
  **It picks back up on March 6th, the day after Stronghold Fox was fully comprised by Krushers in what was undoubtedly a coordinated attack, likely carried by the unique Slammer Krusher as it clearly had a higher intelligence and prioritized important targets, but with only about a hundred of the Stronghold's 5000+ residents surviving the attack, 34 of them including SST 1, Marcus, Garrett, Gavis, Don, Trey, Gabriel, John, Kinn, and 20 other civilians headed out to Nicole, where they hoped to find operational rail line that they could use to escape the Exclusion Zone.**
  
  The episode opens with a flashback-like dream from Trey's childhood: In December 2049 before Christmas, Trey was awoken in the middle of the night from the sound of his older brother, Chris getting ready to run away on his bike _(due to constant abuse from their dad, as indicated later by Trey claiming his dad died before he was born when the topic comes up, yet strangely doesn't seem particularly sad about it.)_
  
  Trey calls out to Chris, and tries to reach out to him with his left hand, which creates a bit of ambiguity as to whose perspective it is, but gets cleared up as Trey then awakens from the dream with his left upper arm in the same relative position.
  
  Trey is buried under a shallow pile of rubble in a small air pocket created by a fallen steel L-beam that held up much of the debris, and some sunlight manage to shine through the rubble, so Trey even without his left arm digs himself out rather easily, having only sustained minor injuries.
  
  Unbeknownst to Trey, his dream was caused by him sensing something that he subconsciously associated with his brother, but thinks nothing of it until Episode 10 when he reunites with him.
  
  
  It's already the morning of March 6th, and the Krushers are long gone, but Stronghold Fox has been comprised and utterly devastated, with the tallest buildings having collapsed, including the SST HQ.
  
  It was clear the previous night that no regular Krushers would've all attacked the Stronghold in such a coordinated manner, especially without the help of the Tall Krusher which seemed to be an evolved variant of Krushers with much higher intelligence, as it focused on taking down the perimeter walls so that the regular Krushers could get into the Stronghold, so Trey figures that the Tall Krusher had somehow coordinated the attack.
  
  Trey then locates his son Gabriel, who hid away in an untouched part of the collapsed building, and was shielded from debris by the body of an SST member, a man who had long since died from a chunk of debris that struck him in the head.
  
  To protect Gabriel's innocence, Trey convinces him that the man had merely fallen asleep, though Gabriel was still traumatized from the sudden attack the previous night.
  
  They go to group with the rest of the survivors who at the ruins of the SST HQ - out of the Stronghold's 5,339 residents, less than 200 of them survived the attack - most of the people involved with SSTs were killed, largely by the Tower-like Krusher which went right for the SST HQ, a detail that creates speculation amongst themselves about the true nature of Krushers, a debate with a level of speculation that hadn't been seen since the first appearance of Krushers in North Eastern Rossgivo 20 years prior.
  
  SST 1, the only SST whose members had all survived, along with remnants of the other SSTs are taking charge of the situation, though disagreements about their actual authority arise, causing the 4 surviving members from SST 4 and about 50 other survivors to split off, to venture out of the destroyed Stronghold while there's still sunlight.
  
  Eventually, SST 1 and 28 other survivors, including Trey, Gabriel, Gavis, Garrett, Kinn, Don, John, Martin, Marcus, and the 2 Rossgivian Veterans who aided in the Millow Civil War, venture out along the same route SST 1 took a couple days prior - most of them are hopeful that they're being led to the new frontlines, but SST 1, Gavis, and Trey know otherwise.
  
  They all reach Thurein just past sunset, somehow without coming across a single Krusher, with not of one them even managing to spot a distant Krusher unlike SST 1's expedition 5 days prior, though they're unsure if those Krushers were being gathered around the Stronghold.
  
  The following morning, the survivors make their way to an old radio station which SST 1 came across during their expedition but _apparently_ weren't able to get it working, though some survivors still try to do so to see if they can pick up any radio signals.
  
  SST 1, Gavis, and Trey _(and other survivors who merely lack relevant expertise)_ don't lend any help, fully aware that they won't receive any signals - Ruiz having told Gavis back at the Stronghold just before it was attacked, which Gavis then told Trey along the way there - which Trey tries to confront Ruiz about without giving it away to the others, though his vagueness makes Ruiz mistake it for Trey trying to get out of 'fixing' the radio tower, so Ruiz makes it clear that he'll let Trey sit it out since he already has enough trouble trying to raise Gabriel, so Trey has to be a bit more direct for Ruiz to figure out what he's trying to say.
  
  
  The survivors reach the ruins of the frontlines 55km southwest from Stronghold Fox, which SST 1 had come across on their expedition only days prior, which although were long since destroyed, appeared to have rushed construction with many areas nearby only having shallow trenches.
  
  Ruiz admits to everyone that they've kept their discoveries on the expedition a secret when they returned to the stronghold but didn't have the time to figure what to do from there, then tells them that _Nicole, the capital, had also fallen_, with no signs of a still functional nation of Rossgivo.
  
  Nicole's stronghold, _Stronghold Iron Fist_, was already overrun and destroyed by Krushers, seemingly never being used _once_ as the only indication of it were small amounts of missing supplies and equipment from shelfs that appeared to have once been fully stocked, but were most likely looted by other survivors passing through considering the doors leading to those such areas had a number of broken doors, leaving them easily accessible to outsiders.
  
  The survivors have to grapple with the fact that the world's strongest nation, Rossgivo, had fallen.

**--EPISODE 4: OUR REALITY**
  [[EP4 Production]]
  
  The last 2 remaining members of The Scouts, after hearing a gunshot the previous night, come across the body of a man who committed suicide using a revolver. They find a journal belonging to the man, which detailed the man's journey, and how he lost his wife and kids to the Krushers only a few days prior to his death.
  
  The man was a wanted criminal on the run, and didn't feel like he'd be safe after escaping the Krushers, but after his wife and two kids died to a Krusher from his own negligence, he felt as if he had nothing left to live for, and committed suicide, leaving behind confessions to his crimes.
  
  The rest of the episode focuses heavily on the impacts Krushers have had on other survivors.

**--EPISODE 5: ROAD TO SANCTUARY**
  [[EP5 Production]]
  
  **The survivors make their way towards the Eastern Mountain Range, where the town of Sanctuary is located, which will be a safe haven for them because the steep mountainsides will prevent Krushers from reaching it, even the seemingly evolved Slammer Krusher that took down Stronghold Fox - at the end of the episode, the survivors manage to reach Sanctuary, as some of the other survivors who split up after the Fall of Stronghold Fox, including Dawson (aka Drone-Guy) encounter a soldier from the Roxian Military and get rescued.**
  
  The survivors arrive at the abandoned mining city _Toko_ on their way towards Sanctuary, which has unique colour-coded architecture with very little decorations _(heavily resembling the style of old Roblox buildings)_, and hadn't been overrun by Krushers though it has almost nothing of value.
  
  According to Kinn, who did a history project for it when he was in High School, Toko was a large major mining city from the 1950s to the early 1970s with a population of 200,000 at its peak, and although the mine's production slowed and its value diminished, causing Toko's population to gradually shrink in size, it wasn't until _2016 when Toko Central Mine was forcefully closed_ as part of a zero-emissions policy by the then newly elected President, cutting out Toko's main source of economic growth, with its already small population of 30,000 plummeting soon after.
  
  Parts of the old Toko Central Mine were repurposed into an underground tunnel in 2049, which bypassed much of the tall somewhat mountainous terrain, but the appearance of Krushers the following year halted construction of its planned later sections _(which Kinn only briefly looked into out of curiosity, unaware of if they were completed or not)_, as it diverted the necessary resources towards constructing trenches on the frontlines.
  
  Toko's last remaining residents were eventually evicted in 2056, but the diversion of resources is why the city wasn't demolished, and was left up to government, which merely restricted the area using a singular chain-link fence that could already be easily bypassed to begin, years before the frontlines had collapsed.


**--EPISODE 6: THE SANCTUARY**
  [[EP6 Production]]
  
  
  
  After some travelling, everyone starts climbing up the mountain where the town of Sanctuary is located, but 2 of The Scouts die when an overhanging piece of snow collapses beneath them.
  
  We time skip from when they get to Sanctuary in July 2070, to January 2071, with noticeable difference in everyone's appearances, and we learn about life in Sanctuary.
  
  The episode ends with a broken electrical cable causing an explosion, resulting in an avalanche, luring the silhouette of a Gear towards Sanctuary.

**--EPISODE 7: HISTORY REPEATS**
  _Ominous thumbnail of a Gear in Sanctuary._
  
  Everyone is awakened by the loud explosion, but while trying to figure out what had happened, and with poor visibility due to a blizzard that night, a Gears climbs up to Sanctuary and starts razing the town, forcing everyone to flee.
  
  The episode ends with the Gear cornering a large group of the survivors, but gets killed by a Roxian Fighter Jet that suddenly swoops down and kills the Gear with 2 missiles.

**--EPISODE 8: GLIMMER OF HOPE**
  We see the perspective of the fighter jet killing the Gear, but the survivors catches his attention by firing a flare, so he circles back to make a salute before flying back to base. 
  
  The survivors stayed in that area until a drone came by the next day to make a supply drop, giving them food, water, equipment, medical supplies - Ruiz gets a blue cast for his seriously injured left arm - and portable anti-Krusher weaponry.

**--EPISODE 9: NEW ROSSGIVO**
  The survivors reach Stronghold Night Owl, or **_New Rossgivo_**, a large Stronghold that still remains operational and is quite lively too, with a population of 50,000, and had been expanded with two lines of trenches dug along the northern outskirts of its city, and aided by the city's canal system based out of a nearby river, which itself serves as a natural barrier.
  
  The leaders and residents of the Stronghold call it "_New Rossgivo_", and even have their own flag, a red and white bi-colour with a yellow star which is essentially identical to the rebellion flag during the 1950 Civilian Revolution, though Gavis points out that it meant power and peace with the star being the spark of change, and using it basically admits that Rossgivo no longer exists.
  
  But when the survivors arrive at the outer northern edge of New Rossgivo, representatives of the Leaders inform the survivors about the peculiar process of admission into New Rossgivo, which the survivors are reasonably confused by as they perceived the Stronghold as a place where they could simply seek refugee in, but they listen to what the process entails.
  
  The survivors, excluding certain people, are tasked with a mission that they must preform to earn the trust of New Rossgivo's Leaders: They're split into 3 groups, each armed with an anti-Krusher cannon for safety which are provided by the Stronghold.
  
  Each group has a unique objective in nearby locations not too far out from the Stronghold that they must complete, which they'll bring back proof of, and once everyone has informed the Stronghold's workers about their observations during their mission, they'll all be admitted into New Rossgivo. 
  
  Certain people are allowed to sit out of the mission and are let into a secure location within the Stronghold but must remain there until everyone else has properly earned admission...
  
  
  
  This is all a ploy to isolate 2 members who are sensed to be Krushers by Harold - a white Roxian man with brown hair who's able to sense Krushers for unknown reasons _(and causes Krushers to avoid harming him, but Harold keeps this a secret)_ - to try and get them killed.
  
  Group 1, which has Trey and Don, goes into a junkyard where they're ambushed by Krushers. Ruiz attempts to hold them off with the anti-Krusher cannon, but when it jams, Trey tries sacrificing himself by throwing one of the explosive shells it uses right into an oncoming Krusher's eye at close range.
  
  This kills the Krusher, but blows apart Trey's right arm, allowing some of the Krusher's blood to enter his bloodstream.
  
  **Offscreen:** Trey subconsciously wishes for his right arm to somehow reattach itself, it reconstructs itself up from what was left of it, right in front of him as if nothing happened.
  
  Gavis catches up to Trey, surprised that he's alright, but asks about the strange positioning of the Krusher's "bodily fluids" on Trey's right arm. Trey struggles to explain what happened, saying that his right arm grew back before passing out, which Gavis passes onto Ruiz, but it doesn't explain why Trey's left arm hasn't, or if any of it even happened.
  
  At the end of the episode, everyone except Ruiz is asleep in a building just outside New Rossgivo, when Trey's left upper arm, which sticks outside of his sleeping bag, suddenly starts emitting small glowing green sparks which seem to partially erase many of the scars on Trey's upper arm, before then taking the outline of what was Trey's left forearm, however the sound effects become more harsh and the sparks begin to flicker.
  
  There's a cut that then shows Ruiz looking over at Trey, pondering over what Trey had meant by his arm having "_grown back_", but eventually goes to sleep, showing not the slightest reaction to the highly conspicuous sparks coming out of Trey's left arm, which suddenly end and fade away soon after without having restored any portion of Trey's left forearm. 
  
  The final scene is of Mr. Cooper looking around amongst the survivors, who have now been let into New Rossgivo, searching for Trey Kelvin - however, even though they seemingly hadn't had any previous intersections, Mr. Cooper asks Trey if he's "_Trey Cooper_", which is apparently Trey's birth name as Trey then connects the dots, realising that Mr. Cooper is his long lost older brother, "_Chris Cooper_".

**--EPISODE 10: UNRAVELING**
  Kinn question Gavis and Trey about how Trey's right arm "grew back" if his left arm hasn't, which they aren't willing to test it because Trey still feels pain, but Trey clarifies that his right arm was reconstructed from its blown off remains like nothing happened, and that he struggled to explain it due to being in a state of panic at the time.
  
  Near the end of the episode, it's revealed that Harold can sense Krushers, and that he's Trey's older brother, an ability Trey also has though mistook it for survival instincts, which Trey's son Gabriel might also have.
  
  However, Harold's ability went off for Trey, Gabriel, and another person who we don't hear the name of, but Harold himself didn't think they were closely related with that other person, but he's more concerned with _why they feel similar to Krushers_.
  
  The other leaders of New Rossgivo however aren't willing to take any chances, so they decide to ambush and kill the "pseudo-Krushers" except Gabriel _(because they believe Gabriel couldn't have in any way helped summon Krushers, as they know full well about the origin of Krushers, and they couldn't appear out of nowhere on their own, let alone in the worst places at the worst times.)_

**--EPISODE 11: CONFLICT**
  Idea: Gavis, who had been personally protecting Trey from the New Rossgivo Fighters, brutally stabs one of the fighters to death out of rage after the man shot Trey, Gavis's longtime friend for 11 years, with a shotgun at close range. Even though Trey could recover his wounds _(albeit not without enduring pain from receiving the wounds)_, and Gavis's attack went beyond the scope of self defense or protection.
  
  This shows just how connected Gavis is to Trey, and separates us from Gavis's usual carefree humorous attitude by placing him in a stressful and emotionally damaging scenario, showing his strength and fierceness _even with his old age_. 

**--EPISODE 12: WHAT THEY ARE**
  After Trey's death from an unknown perpetrator, Harold reveals documentation of an old Top Secret government project into Krushers that goes back all the way to 1975, which only a select few of New Rossgivo know about. It was discovered locked away in a nearby apartment building just outside New Rossgivo, presumably the apartment of one of the project's former researchers.
  
  The project concerns the use of BRK-D8, a deadly poison, in subjects who have a near-complete lack of two or more groups of foreign DNA, and are part of the 10th generation or higher where such conditions have been avoided.
  
  If BRK-D8 is injected into such subjects, it can awaken seemingly otherworldly abilities (further details are redacted, with no explanation on how it was discovered) These abilities often don't abide by the laws of physics (...) If foreign DNA gets reintroduced into the subjects, they retain their resistance to BRK-D8, but their special abilities aren't immediately obvious to the subjects, likely a result of their conflicting DNA.


**--EPISODE 13: FALL OF ROSSGIVO**

**--EPISODE 14: UNMASKED**
  The main casts stays at New Rossgivo for a couple days after the conflict, with the people responsible for mounting an attack against them now punished, but during this time, Harold _(Trey's older brother, which Trey only told Gavis about, but not the fact he himself, his son Gabriel, and Don all had very similar 'auras' to Krushers, which still remains completely unknown to them)_ is discovered to have been murdered in his office, creating further distrust between the main cast and the residents of New Rossgivo.
  
  Soon after the attack ended, while they were still located outside in the abandoned urban ruins near New Rossgivo where it took place, and with Ruiz mourning the deaths of Cale and Dave, Nathan and the surviving Free Millowian Fighter interrogate the 12 captured individuals who took part in the attack, to figure out their motive for doing so, and how they seemingly knew about Trey's unexplained Krusher-like regenerative abilities despite them never possibly witnessing it beforehand.
  
  They learn that there's someone (Harold, but his identity was kept secret from the attackers) who could sense the presence of Krushers, and has protected New Rossgivo from numerous Krusher attacks, even ones led by Gear or Slammer variants.
  
  
  
  Strangely, they learn that the sharpshooter who killed Trey _wasn't a position explicitly stated to be part of the attack_ when it was being planned, and that 60 people took part in the attack, however they were all accounted for.
  
  The likely explanation is that a skilled marksman manage to shoot Trey in the head from afar using a regular rifle, and with the other 48 attackers all confirmed dead, that marksman could be hiding among one of the 12 captured attackers.
  
  However, according to those 12 attackers themselves, there apparently weren't any trained sharpshooters part of the attack, and at most there were only a handful of people who used to go deer hunting as a hobby.

**--EPISODE 15: TWISTED PERSPECTIVE**
  Following up after Don's betrayal and the reveal of his seemingly supernatural powers, this episode focuses on Don's motivations, and the reveal of several unexplained events throughout the series that he himself had influenced as shown from his perspective.
  
  We first see what appears a lab for human experimentation, with a scared clueless child strapped down to a tilted twin bed sized concrete slab, across from a mirror on the opposing wall which is presumably a one-way window for whoever is overlooking the experiment, all while the child seemingly shouts out for help in an intelligible foreign language.
  
  A tall slender man wearing a long white lab coat that reaches down to the man's knees, enters the chamber through a door over in a corner out of sight from the child, whom the man walks over to and injects a purple fluid substance using a syringe into the child's left arm, before promptly leaving the chamber.
  
  Once the man leaves, a mechanical device with a rotatable sharp metal blade attached to the tip of its robotic arm, descends down from the ceiling where the device is attached to, before its blade slices off the child's left pinky finger in a quick gruesome motion, causing the child to scream out in agony. 
  
  Then it's revealed what the purpose of this seemingly torture-like human experiment is for, as the remains of the child's detached pinky finger lying on the floor gradually disassembles itself, and floats back up, reconstructing itself back onto the child's hand piece by piece until there's no sign of any injuries on the child's left pinky finger that had only been inflicted hardly 20 seconds prior.
  
  
  
  
  
  Focuses on Don's perspective of his involvement in using Krushers to fight against Rossgivo, a nation that helped fund unethical human experiments on his ancestors due to the supernatural abilities they had, one of which was the _Power of Reconstruction_ that allowed its user to freely manipulate the physical structure of objects without getting restricted by the laws of physics.
  
  The previous holder of the power of Reconstruction helped free all of Don's ancestors, but since they were taken in as kids and intentionally left uninformed of their abilities, the knowledge of how to awaken their supernatural abilities was lost along the way, but they could use portions of the power of Reconstruction by using blood samples containing it among the ruins of the old facility that they had been kept in.
  
  The biology of Wall Krushers were the result of a botched attempt at creating artificial lifeforms by the (previous) holder of Reconstruction, which generally followed the basic components of humans but the holder's near lack of knowledge about its biology caused them to misinterpret their actual functions: The 'blood' were merely body fluids with a similar appearance as it didn't contain proteins or nutrients (though this wasn't problematic as...)

**--EPISODE 16: ESCAPE**
  We see how the Kuluho were treated inhumanely by the Other People, the things Don has done throughout the series, and how he feels them to be justified.
  
  _SCENE: THE BEGINNING_
   The location is a small paved road surrounded by dense rainforest.
   
   We see a young dark-skinned girl with long brown hair, being forced by 2 large white-skinned men into a small cage that's in the back of a white pickup truck, who then drape a cover over the cage after locking the girl inside. The conversation between the men reveal them to be Human Traffickers.
   
   The 2 men drive off, as the young girl grabs a necklace on her neck, which suddenly begins glowing a faint green. Suddenly, large blue spikes shoot out from the cage, bringing the pickup truck to a violent halt, as it rips it and the 2 men seated in the passengers' compartment apart.
   
   The girl emerges from the (now destroyed) cage unscathed, as another car starts coming up the same road, which the girl throws an indirect attack towards before running the opposite way, causing the driver to panic and quickly drive back in reverse, getting the car stuck in the surrounding greenery.
   
  After the first example of spiritual powers, we learn about what they require, through accounts of nearby townsfolk who traced it back to the "cursed necklace" the girl was wearing - A Spiritual Necklace from the Kuluho.
  
  The Power of Reconstruction is revealed by Don: An ability all Krushers use to rebuild any damage inflicted to their bodies, and to manipulate their body fluids to either reinforce their outer skin, or to move through immense inertia from within their bodies.
  
  Don uses an injection of BRK-D8 to temporarily give himself free control over the power of Reconstruction, morphing his body and the surrounding environment into the form of a Gear, but the large portion of foreign DNA he has quickly causes his free control over the power to wear away, limiting it to only rebuilding Don's new body back into the original state of the Gear he had constructed.
  
  Don is almost killed by Ruiz, who with the the help of the last 3 members of SST 1, sacrifices himself to detonate powerful explosives at point blank range next to Don before he could use his body fluids to protect himself in time, blowing apart most of Don's body. However, Don survives by protecting his still human-sized brain with his body fluids and lets them fling out of his body onto a nearby rooftop, but it takes him a few minutes to reconstruct his body as he's relocating almost all of it onto the rooftop, which also leaves Don immobilized as he's doing so, but the last of SST 1 aren't familiar enough with the area to reach Don and finish him off before then.
  
  During this downtime, Kinn decides to inject Gabriel with a syringe of BRK-D8, claiming that Gabriel will receive superpowers which Gabriel fully believes, though Kinn is only going off the fact that Don told him (before he turned into a Gear) that _"his peoples' descendants"_ are immune to the normally fatal effects of BRK-D8 blood poisoning.
  
  Because Trey didn't have any such effects, and Gabriel was his son, Kinn assumed that at the very least it wouldn't do anything, but might give Gabriel regenerative abilities that his Trey somehow had before he died, which could allow Gabriel a direct attack from Don.
  
  The BRK-D8, along with Gabriel fully believing he'd receive superpowers, plus the fact he was wearing his dad Trey's necklace, who believed in the existence of spirits and taught them to his son Gabriel, resulted in a spiritual awakening within Gabriel. This granted Gabriel the power of Reconstruction when he attempts to protect Kinn from a direct attack from Don _(who had fully regenerated by this point)_, with a spiritual awakening so immense it was sensed by anyone who could form spiritual connections regardless of how far they were.
  
  Gabriel, not understanding the power he has, treats different applications of it as different superpowers. According to Don, the power of Reconstruction allows one to freely alter the physical structure of one or multiple objects in whatever manner they desire. All Krushers technically have and can use Reconstruction, but it's limited to reverting damage done to their bodies, and to forcefully put an object within their bodies in motion _(as in body fluids, but it's still heavily dependent on the laws of physics)_




_--SCRAPPED EPISODES--_

**--EPISODE 4: THE SCOUTS**
  We learn the story behind _The Scouts_, a group of 7 males currently aged 17 to 20, who were all part of a boy scouts camping trip in June 2065 when the frontlines about 35km away were breached by a stray Gear, leading to the nearby forested wilderness being overrun by Krushers until they were stopped along the wilderness's edge. New frontlines would be built along it, with strips of forest cleared out to allow for their construction in any areas that managed to be recaptured, however they would soon fall only a couple months later in January 2066.
  
  7 Boy Scouts who were left behind in their tent throughout the initial ordeal, presumably due to the unusual remote location of the tent chosen by the older kids of the group. Now left all alone, they banded together to survive, looting supplies from around the abandoned campsite for food, and would even cook their own food using whatever equipment and recipes they could find.
  
  The number of nearby Krushers also quickly went down in only the first of the boys surviving on their own, however they wouldn't make it out of the wilderness until March 2066 during the spring when it was warm, but ended up being _well after the fall of Rossgivo_.
  
  They'd continue roaming the ruins of Rossgivo for the next 4 years, until the stronghold survivors came across them because of a small campfire they set on a nearby rooftop, whom they although tried to fight against since they hadn't interacted with other living people in almost 5 years and didn't know what to expect, they later made it clear that it was an attempt act of self defense after realising the stronghold survivors weren't a threat _(largely thanks to Ruiz's military uniform, as he was the first person to go onto the rooftop.)_

**--EPISODE 6: FIGHT BACK**
  When the bridge over the Great Chasm is found to have been destroyed, and they're confronted by a Slammer blocking their escape route, everyone chooses to fight and kill the Slammer, ultimately succeeding.


_--CUT SCENES--_

(Trey at the store)
 _Trey_, a 32 year old Caucasian man, in a small convivence store shopping for a _singular glove_ during the early morning at the start of winter, as shown by the light snowfall around the area.
 
 The store and the surrounding buildings have Netherlands-style architecture, but the neon sign above the store's entrance appears to have had its branding removed, leaving it plainly as "_Store_" which the branded segment had offset to the right.
 
 Trey grabs a right handed glove from an open bin, and attempts to buy only that glove despite him also seemingly trying to buy a regular white-coloured packaged pair which are a bit smaller, which reasonably confuses the mid 20s aged cashier who was in the middle of reading a novel, but quickly realises that Trey is missing his left forearm, though Trey is also trying to buy a pair of gloves for his child.
 
 Apparently, the fact Trey has a child is unique enough for the cashier to identify him by name, which surprises Trey but he brushes it aside and asks if they have a child-sized pair for the packaged gloves in storage, which the cashier then goes into the back to grab, though Trey gets to have them for free since he's likely the only person in the Stronghold who'd ever need them.
 
 _Trey would've gave them to his son Gabriel so that they could build a snowman_.

_SCENE: JOHN_
   John was the Plant Manager of Perksons Power Plant a couple months before the Fall of Chinelo, but rather than the usual collapse of the electric grid as is common in apocalyptic stories, Perksons Power Plant is advanced enough to operate on its own, and can automatically adjust the power levels of its 3 reactor units to match demand.
   
   Since Perksons Power Plant was meant to service Northern Rossgivo - not just Chinelo - after the Fall of Chinelo, it only has to run at a very minimal level to power Stronghold Fox, which was supposed to have its own isolated grid but its lackluster construction left it connected to Chinelo's electrical grid _(most of the power lines connecting the grids were taken down, but a good number of them still remained for whatever reason, so it effectively changed nothing)_, so the power plant has been sustaining the stronghold's power for the past 5 years with very little need for maintenance, much to the surprise of John. 
   
   John is currently in the middle of a night-watch in a large utility room with 6 large generators, bulky batteries line one of the walls, there's a couple shelfs for storage and equipment, and beside a generator next to John - who has long since dozed off while seated in a chair - is a dashboard full of controls, indicators, and gauges.
   
   There's a hum of a running generator in the background.
   
   One gauge, highlighted by a red ring, shows the power produced by the generators against the recent consumption of power, _which the generators fall well below_, but a note taped below the gauge explains that it isn't broken though it only includes the _Stronghold's_ generators, and that the rest of the power is being supplied by the _Perksons Power Plant_ which we saw beforehand, _however its mention by name shows that it isn't related to the stronghold_.
   
   There's a short pause before the hum of a running generator is interrupted by a moderately loud alarm that goes off alongside a flashing bright red indicator on the dashboard, giving time to read the note and shows that the low gauge didn't trigger the alarm but the reactor shutdown we saw right beforehand.
   
   The alarm wakes up John but he manually mutes the alarm before figuring out what triggered it, and he's more so confused than worried.
   
   John identifies the cause of the alarm as _insufficient power production_, which apparently has its own unique tone, but he admits to himself that the alarm normally should've already been going off given only one of the Stronghold's 6 generators were running, though even if all 6 were running the power production would still fall short, albeit by a small margin.
   
   John had previously attempted to remove the alarm altogether so it wouldn't constantly go off, but doing so would somehow break the entire dashboard, so he instead reversed its circuitry as if it took the output as input and vice-versa, which sometimes sets the alarm off during the night when the power production of a single generator could just barely surpass the amount of power being consumed.
   
   John notes that the Stronghold is still connected to the old electrical grid for whatever reason - it was supposed to have its own isolated grid, John assumes that the power lines which were left up was just out of laziness - and he's familiar with Perksons Power Plant, even pointing out that the standard protocol would've been to shutdown the reactor units which would've taken only a couple minutes, but if that didn't happen and the reactors were left online, it would explain the power source that sustains Stronghold Fox's power which wouldn't require any human interaction.

_SCENE: AN UNNERVING FEELING_
   The date is March 1st, 2070, the night after SST 1 left on their 19th expedition when a fierce thunderstorm hits Stronghold Fox _(which ceases the supply of power from Perksons Power Plant to the Stronghold a short while later, so the John scene continues with the same audio for the storm)_, though the Calendar is strangely bland and unbranded since it was printed out in the Stronghold purely for the purpose of functionality.
   
   _Trey_, a 32 year old Caucasian man with brown hair who's missing his left forearm, visible scarring on his left elbow suggesting he lost it in an accident years prior, however he doesn't have a prosthetic for it, walks over to his apartment's living room where he expects his 3 year old son, _Gabriel_, to be playing with his toy cars and trucks that were collected by SSTs over the years _(mostly by Gavis whenever he got the chance, being a longtime friend of Trey's.)_   
   
   Strangely, Gabriel, a small boy with black hair that he inherited from his mother, is standing on the living room's brown couch looking out the window above it, his toys still scattered around a city play mat laid out on the hardwood floor, deeply focused on something in the distance.
   
   Because Trey's apartment is several floors up in a building along the west perimeter wall of Stronghold Fox, the windows provide unobstructed views of the surrounding ruins of Chinelo, which Trey isn't fond of since Gabriel was born and raised inside the Stronghold, and Trey kept him in the dark about Krushers, but doesn't consider moving apartments to be worth the effort.
   
   Trey is a bit unnerved, but brushes it off and tells Gabriel that it's time for bed, as is clear from Gabriel's blue full body star patterned pajamas and the dark night sky, and Trey is even willing to clean up Gabriel's toys himself that night.
   
   Gabriel, clearly not listening to what Trey just said, asks him about "_the thing_" in the distance outside the Stronghold which he points towards, prompting Trey to walk over to see what Gabriel is talking about, since Gabriel is only 3 years old yet looks to be genuinely confused about what he saw.
   
   Trey initially assumes it's related to the stormy weather, perhaps strange looking clouds, or a distant lightning rod Gabriel might think is controlling the lightning, however Trey struggles to figure out what Gabriel is pointing at due to the heavy rain.
   
   Trey asks Gabriel, in simple words he can understand, to describe what he saw, but all Trey gets is that it's far out to the west of the Stronghold, it's taller than the surrounding buildings, but it's only briefly visible during flashes of lightning so Gabriel doesn't know anything else about its appearance, however Gabriel feels that it's "_staring at him_", but he's too young to properly explain it.
   
   The oddly specific details Gabriel provided didn't seem to be anything he might've picked up from a story or movie as far as Trey can tell, and it didn't sound anything like a Krusher, even if Gabriel _somehow_ knew what they were.
   
   Trey decides to take Gabriel to bed at that point, but not without pondering over what Gabriel was talking about as he cleans up his toys and puts away the dishes before heading off to sleep.
   
   While lying in his queen-sized bed, with some emphasis is placed on its empty side - presumably being where Gabriel's dead mother would've rested judging by the urn that was shown in the background earlier, resting on a shelf in the living room - Trey gets up and looks out his own bedroom's window to try and see what Gabriel was pointing at.
   
   Out of the corner of his eye, Trey spots a tall thin silhouette about a couple hundred metres west of the Stronghold as it's briefly lit up by a flash of lightning, but Trey gets a strange feeling before he even notices it which almost immediately goes away.
   
   Trey immediately fixes his eyes right where he saw the silhouette, but during the 12 seconds before the next flash of lightning, the silhouette had seemingly disappeared entirely.
