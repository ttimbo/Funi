Me and my family were traveling down a highway, when we had to abandon our car on the road, and walk down to the next rest stop, as did everyone else on that road.
We decided to spend the night there, but the line of apartment buildings had varying designs: The first few looked modern and had different coloured exteriors, which most of the other people immediately starting filing into, some buildings looked quite sketchy with exposed outdoor walkways, but the one we went into had grass turfs covering the walls and ceilings.
The grass turf building didn't have a front door, just an open doorway, and had several levels of outdoor-ish walkways to access all the rooms, requiring the use of ladders to travel between them. We went down an L-shaped passage from the entrance (starting from the short end, heading west, then turned right to continue down the long end, heading north), and didn't go into any of the other rooms, until we reached the end where Sierra was apparently working, and it had a plain white door with a grey non spherical doorknob.
The workplace was at least 2 levels in height, rectangular, with the white door being the midpoint of one of the shorter sides, and had a white walkway with railings supported by columns below, which lead to a ladder to access the areas below.
When we entered, there was a Caucasian lady sleeping on a white chair, with purple to pink coloured hair, wearing a white shirt and dark grey pants, and was in her mid or late 20s.
After going down to the lower level, I realized the workplace was a nursery of some sort, having cribs with sleeping babies, and filled with toddler and infant toys, children books, and also had those coloured play mats which could connect with each other.
Sierra was sleeping on a blue hammock, supported by white rope tied to the columns, and had a white blanket covering her but wasn't big enough to cover anything below her knees.
That was the last thing I remember.

After my view panned through what appears a 60s era city skyline, I saw large, square of people on the ground, lined up shoulder to shoulder, all standing at attention, facing 60 degrees clockwise from where my view had been panning in from (not from above, just from, if my view was level with the ground) Winston Churchill was pacing back and forth in front of these people, shouting a speech about how their population will increase by 600,000 within 10 years.
I literally don't remember how that went to a Japanese classroom setting (I did start re-watching 'Whisper Of The Heart' last night so maybe that's why) I only saw male high school students, wearing their typical summer uniform: Buttoned-up collared white shirt, black pants. 3 students were harassing a kid named "Su Suga" for whatever reason, and I decided to stand up for them. I was suddenly outside despite not even moving, because I could see green grass on the ground, and in front of me was a thin blank grey sign which had nothing on it, aside from "SU SUGA" in that form, in large white letters attached onto the sign. That's all I remember.

It was some sort of PVP Roblox game, we were to be divided into colour-coded teams of two, but I got put into the Cyan team which already had two people, and the Purple team had four people.
While we waited (for something?) We kept in separate rooms (I assume) with only our teammates, the walls, floor, and ceiling were a dark grey, there was a small light on the ceiling, and the room had at least one window to the outside, with 3 grey (lighter tone) vertical bars, and it was too high up to see anything out of it other than sunlight streaming in. On the opposing walls from this window, there was a wedge spanning the full width of each of the two walls, making a somewhat steep ramp up against them, which stopped just before reaching the ceiling which let anyone with a regular R6 avatar to still touch the vertical wall with their torso.
During all of this, one of my teammates complained about the Purple team still getting new members, which indeed was the case after I checked the Leaderboard. That's all I remember. 


_August 30, 2024_
Scrolling down the comment section of a video which I don't remember anything about, I came across a comment that I knew was completely unrelated to the video, which may have been edited as the comment was warning about _SQL Injections_ in the replies (e.g. "WARNING! PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SPAMMING SQL INJECTIONS IN THE REPLIES!")

After clicking "_Read More_", the comment went on a long, detailed explanation of SQL injections (which I know nothing about) on how they work, the ways to create one, and how to use it (along with several samples of complex code, in green text) (The comment was more of a website by this point, I probably went off a _Luraph De-Obfuscation Guide_ since that's what it mostly resembled.)

At the bottom was a list of Minecraft Servers (?) apparently at risk of these SQL injections, which you could scroll down and it'd show you a full page picture of each server, along with its name: The first might've been a minigames server, and the title was in alternating colours. The second was _Greenville_ and titled accordingly. The third and last server was called _BUILD CITY_, I assume that was the objective, and the picture was of a bunch of repeating lines of wooden house and buildings, which resembled ski mountain style wooden lodges, in a mountainous eternal winter environment.

That's all I remember.


_October 25, 2024_

I had a dream about some sort of class system.

My dream focused on at least one person with a _low class_, who wore a belt.

That's literally all I remember.


_October 30, 2024_

There was a different world that nobody could leave, which all sorts of people were transported to (out of thin air) over the years.

One of the first people to arrive, a (now) adult female, was apart of a team of scavengers (I'll call them "The Scavengers" because I'd hadn't actually named them) who decided to ask fellow scavengers about how they feel about their contributions ever since they arrived in the world.

This was seen through the POV of the adult female (though he seemed more like a TV interview), who asked 2 scavengers, one with 10 years experience, the other 3 years experience, who both had positive things to say, and felt as if they've done something for everyone else.

That's all I remember.


_November 9, 2024_

I remember a game (in dream only) where there some sort of massive ravaging monster, inside a city consisting of almost entirely all-white small rise buildings, with a couple pools strewn around, there wasn't even any parking lots, and the streets and roads weren't too noticeable.

I managed to somehow glitch a spectating feature to lock my view onto _Historia Reiss_ while still being able to move my own character, but I could hardly go anywhere because Historia flew away (not ODM Gear, but still affected by gravity in some form) from me, so I didn't know where I actually was.

I'm basing the idea it was _Historia_ off of a thumbnail of Historia going up against Rod Reiss, which quickly faded in and out randomly, as if the thumbnail was in full screen mode, but didn't go halfway to being fully opaque before fading out.


I don't remember anything else of that _game_, but I remember a 4, drawn on a piece of paper in such way that it could also look like a 2, though it didn't have the 2's bottom half so it was drawn as if it was meant to be a 7 instead.

That's all I remember.


_08:05 CDT November 16, 2024_

I believe the dream started with Me and Sierra working on a video together, and I hardly remember anything between this and the second part aside from a medieval setting in some form.

Me and Sierra were working on video in the original Roblox High School, using a similar setup to what I currently have (_laptop off to the left, hooked up to my Dad's old monitor as its screen_) We were basing the video off of a graphic novel (perhaps it was a Spiderman comic, despite its size) and Sierra kept trying to balance the book on the cords that were connected to my laptop, or she was trying to prop her phone on her book because she said she was trying to setup a webcam (face cam) either way it kept on falling...

The second part of the dream was about many popular characters in media, such as Spiderman and that Disney princess in the blue dress, most of whom started getting transported into different dimensions, but the dimensions they started had pretty much nothing to do with their characters.

I watched it happen at least 2 times, I don't remember the first time, but the second time happened with Spiderman, that Disney princess in the blue dress, along with two others I don't remember anything about.
The four of them were walking towards the right, across the cracking drylands of the stereotypical wild west, just without any tumbleweeds, and while the sun started to rise or set.

For Spiderman, the ground below him suddenly started falling apart revealing a pure black void, Spiderman just barely managed to grab the ledge while the other 3 looked back in surprise (they actually looked blankly at him during the dream, but it's what I felt their reaction to be) Spiderman eventually slipped towards the void and fell in.


There was a 3000 metre (3 km) tall Dragon, its wings nowhere near strong enough to fly, its eyes and mouth were pure black voids with white sparkling borders, its neck was long, scaly, and _highly elastic_, and its arm were long and lanky, which could easily swipe at anything on the ground simply by the Dragon crouching down.

{The Dragon tried to bite at Spiderman on his way down, which he just barely avoided, and somehow survived the long fall without any injuries.}

The most notable aspect of the Dragon long tail, which was being followed by a long line of a species that had long since been devastated by the Dragon, having occurred a millennia prior, with the remains of the species following the tail of the Dragon "_in hopes of the Dragon someday bringing them up in its warm embrace_" (in other words, they wish for the Dragon to someday have mercy of their species.)

This endangered species was left unnamed, so I'm calling them _Handies_ because they looked like the MC of _Double King_, just without their big cutesy eyes, and wearing old and rag-like clothes.

The Handies {which Spiderman had come across} were always on the move for virtually their entire lifespans, having adapted to the long moving line, caring for one another inside the moving line, and were so closely packed together I could barely see the tip of the Dragon's tail ending just before it would've gone out of view.

The Dimension the Dragon and the Handies was in perpetual darkness, with any scattered ruins only becoming visible with a sufficient light source, or once the Dragon came up close to it.

The Dragon came across a Handie that was all alone, crouched down, and brutally swiped the Handie away with its right arm, revealing the large charcoal black claws the Dragon had.

As the Dragon began walking out of view towards the left, and the true scale of the Handies population slowly started becoming more apparent, I woke up.


_November 24, 2024_

My dream was in two parts: first with the cast if My Hero Academia going on a vacation to a remote island via ship, the second with 3 short stories with a cast of 3-4 different characters, each with their own voice actors, where each short story wasn't connected to the other short stories _(such as with one female character who was in two stories, but had entirely different personalities)_

The only other things I remember was that in the first part, they sailed on a grey-coloured ship, with darker grey blocky funnels that had the ramps leading from base to tip in front of them, and from my perspective over the open ocean, it sailed left.

Once on the island, the Electric Dude took a group photo by flipping his phone's camera around, capturing a bit of the island's lush green terrain.

The last things I remember was that in the second part, in the third short story, the female was a school student, with olive skin, brown hair, light blue shirt, dark blue shorts (which I couldn't see?) and she was in the cafeteria which had light blue walls, and dark blue benches and tables. That's all.


_12/26/2024_

I had a zombie apocalypse themed dream, which wasn't a nightmare, and it had some interesting ideas I'd like to remember.

First part was L4D2 themed - a mountainous environment amidst a blizzard. I was looking at the survivors from a freecam sort of view, and I saw Ellis go up a "climb" (a rocky mountain face, also I recently watched a World of Tanks forging a "climb", and that's where I got the name from) Ellis gone up to a new area which was at a considerably higher elevation, but not too grueling to climb up to, before Ellis got attacked by a large horde of zombies in that new area.

Pretty sure there was a new map afterwards, where the climb was instead a ramp, but that's all I remember about it.

There was another map called "Apartments", set on a rooftop of apartments, but bore little resemblance to the ones in L4D and L4D2, as it was setup for a party before the apocalypse presumably interrupted it. One side, a rectangular portion, went up another floor, allowing for roof access and it's the zombies would come from.

I was probably playing as Ellis, because I had short sleeves, and I also saw Rochelle and Coach, which on an unrelated note, where getting drunk for whatever reason? There was only zombie that showed up, a Tank, as if it was the start of a horde that never came.

We could move props around, including Rochelle and Coach, who did so despite being NPCs.

The Tank got ragdolled in a pile of junk we've made, even though it was still alive, but chose _not_ to get up for whatever reason.

That's all I remember about it.

Then my dream switched over to be about The Walking Dead, despite the fact I basically never watched the show, but I want to wrap this entry up so:
* Other animals could spread the Green Flu, including bugs.
* There was a special bug that helped crops grow.
* It was mutated heavily to help crops grow much more efficiently, but
* this made the bug more infectious at spreading the Green Flu, which, if infected, was spread through a black sludge that got pushed out of its body when it died.

There was a train station of some sort, with two tracks - one was a continuous track which ran alongside the train station and continued out into the surrounding city, the other connected to that track at the train station, and just poked out of the trees and greenery opposite of the train station, which obstructed the rest of the track.

The continuous track was for Passengers, whilst the connected track was for Cargo; these tracks also had different 'trains', one with regular locomotives _(albeit unusual for passenger trains)_, the other with weird car-powered _(Already defeating the point of a train - No idea how it worked though, aside from someone slamming down on the gas as a convoluted method of momentum)_ engines strapped down onto a train carriage _(as if it was cargo that got disconnected from the head of the train and left behind)_ respectively.

Inside the train station's indoor area _(don't know if it's an actual thing)_ was a clean white well-lit interior, but to the left was a nice large movie theater.

The theater had a double doors entrance made of a chiseled darkish brown wood, with 3 vertical rows of two small square windows - one on both doors - and another 2 windows above the doors that curved downward alongside an arch at the top.

Inside the theater, the walls were made of the same wood, but with a far more elaborate chiseled pattern, and the seats were wooden with purple cushions that had a white splotch pattern _(it was something I vaguely recall seeing from an old relative's house, not sure who)_

Daylight was streaming in through the windows, not great for a movie theater, but I figured there were blackout curtains already in place that would get lowered beforehand.

Someone I knew was binging movies or something in that theater, so I'd periodically pop in after each movie to see the extra showing between them, because the movie would technically be over so I wouldn't need a ticket to enter.

While I would be waiting outside by the tracks, I'd start pondering about the passengers waiting for the occasional train, and wondered if one of the car-powered trains could come over to the train station and pick up some of the waiting passengers _(despite being meant for cargo, having a far lower passenger capacity, being much slower, and would probably just hold up whatever trains those passengers gone onto anyway.)_

That's all I remember.

It was a dream about something that was like a large-scale dam breaching, as it flooded massive amounts of shoreline, and obliterated the "dam" almost entirely, with it, a tall concrete tower used by workers for maintenance access, and the surrounding forest, all almost entirely gone afterwards.

The incident went as such: Two workers wearing safety helmets but different coloured uniforms, climbed up the concrete tower to work on the 'dam' - The dam was actually a tall wall, just for kicks as far as I knew, but it certainly wasn't a dam - one worker, who had a white uniform, carried an oversized yellow 'plug', which was plugged into a large white socket in the ground - pointing up - near the base of the tower, which looked sort of like a voltage converter for foreign plugs.

The second worker, who had a green uniform, followed behind White, carrying a clipboard to keep track of their work _(primarily White's work, but Green could've just been a supervisor)_ They came up to platform - which had large grate in the centre - in front of what looked like a large Vault door.

Don't remember exactly what happened, maybe White plugged the oversized plug into a socket inside the Vault door, or maybe White took the plug out, but Green noticed what White was doing, ran towards White shouting "No!", before everything blacked out.

Afterwards, I saw the aftermath from someone else's perspective.

It was the largest worker-related tragedy in history, likely killing hundreds during the severe flooding, most of which caused by the large wall blocking their escape, causing them to drown.

A smaller barrier was built after the disaster as a memorial - large sea-like rocks stacked all along the shoreline. That's all I remember.


_3/1/2025_

I had a dream that I was building a house (like in Sims 4, but not specifically in Sims 4) which was just a single upside down trapezoid room, and I was trying to get a door to function properly. The game would give periodically hints (but I gave up, and I think I just searched online) and apparently, _"You're the Boss Baby now"_, meant I was orientating the door the wrong way (even though it probably wouldn't affect anything normally) The door (front door to be specific) was apparently just being propped up against the wall in a door frame, despite looking like it was in the wall from outside the house.

Also, the Boss Baby thing also had him walking through several doors with only their frames, in a location that heavily resembled somewhere within door sorting place in Monsters Inc.

I remember that I doing some freelancer work, specifically a commission on something like Fiverr (don't know if it was the first thing, or the mid point, but I believe it was the mid point) for some sort of "One Piece" themed outdoors park for $5, probably to make a banner for advertising _(It was called "One Pierce", but I doubt it was to avoid copyright, and I think it was literally the name of the actual location)_ The park was surrounded by a bunch of RVs, and basically only had bench tables, slip and slides, and an ice vendor which looked like it was operating out of one of the RV's.

Afterwards, the dream then switched over to the main characters from the Clinical Trial Game _(one day after I first played it, too)_: Angel, and Lee.

They owned a massive manor-like house: It had a dark brown wooden exterior, cone shaped roofs, large windows, at least 2 but maybe 3 floors tall, and it had a large yard out front, with the property surrounded by a low cobblestone fence.

The dream focused on the first person perspective of Angel: It was raining, and she seemed mad or upset, and even Lee came outside with an umbrella to shelter Angel from the rain, she didn't acknowledge Lee at all, even after they went inside.

Angel just took off her soaked shoes next to the kitchen table - which was near the front door - and walked away.

That's all I remember.


_July 8, 2025_

It was on a highway surrounded by dense forest with mountainous terrain and a couple buildings here and there, kind of like Clear Lake in how it felt.

Chao Racers: A 30 year old Lumberjack-like with a red checkboard buttoned up red shirt, blue dirtied jeans, and brown haired man with a jeep, a shotgun, and a large bushy beard, who can return to certain checkpoints back in time, and needs to get ahead of a faster rouge reckless driving school bus currently on a field trip, by bouncing his jeep off of surrounding structures to fling his jeep ahead in the bus's path like some sort of speed run strat, which he eventually does manage to do by turning back using a roundabout and flinging his jeep off the slanted roofs of wooden buildings, and starts driving off-road down a creek between two mountain which fed into the nearby ocean, in order to intercept the bus still on the highway.

However, it suddenly cut to two other people with the lumberjack who are about to look over his route compared to that of the bus: Both white, a man with short spiky black hair a cyan long-sleeved shirt and black pants, and a lady with brown hair tied back in a ponytail using a black hair tie, purple lipstick and long-sleeved shirt, and blue pants.

The map was of by hometown on google maps, which didn't match the setting at all though.

Apparently, much to the confusion of the other two, the Lumberjack went well ahead the bus - both routes didn't correspond to actual roads, and the bus's route definitely went through buildings - both were making their way towards the Ave, but the lumberjack was outside the city, while the bus which started from the south end of the Tupper bridge but still hadn't made it west of the neighboring intersection (to the intersection on the Ave directly south of the Tupper bridge) or reached the Ave yet.

The two point out that the Lumberjack could've just headed west to intercept the bus, which is Lumberjack was very clearly shocked by like he didn't even know he could do that.

That's all I remember.

I remember 'playing' on a small map in Guts and Blackpowder style, which seemed to be in the middle of the ocean since I didn't see a coastline though it was presumably behind me, and I walking up shoreline rocks that led to a white-painted lighthouse, with a raised wooden platform that had stairs on my side _(I was approaching the lighthouse)_ located in the middle of the rock path.

I was using my saber to kill people on the 'other team' on my way to the lighthouse, who felt more like plain zombies considering how I was killing them, and both me and them had blue uniforms, but some people on the other team had tall furry hats.

I didn't make it to the lighthouse, but I wasn't stopped by the other team, so I'm sure something else happened at this point, but I don't remember what it was, or if anything did happen.

At the end of my dream, with some sort of buildup to it (could've been the thing that happened before then as mentioned in the previous sentence, but I can't say for sure), I was stalking _(this felt more normal in my dream)_ a group of people to see if any one of them was a military officer, which I could figure out since they apparently were the only ones whose bullets had shiny casing - though I doubt I could've seen anything like that using my binoculars, even if one of them had a revolver which wouldn't make much sense considering their casual civilian appearance - there was 4 of them, all female, one was an elderly woman with short white-gray hair, a purple long-sleeved shirt, and a darker purple knee-length skirt, another was a middle-aged woman who had blond to black hair that looked like it was dyed - even though the setting switched to a realistic, RDR2 style, which really made it look out of place - and wore a light yellow long-sleeved shirt, the other two I don't really remember besides they were the tallest and shortest of the group.

I was looking at them in a car on a dirt road that surrounded by rural grain farmlands, with the group of 4 down at a 3-way intersection up ahead, chatting amongst themselves and seemed to be intrigued by something in the distance.

There wasn't anything in my dream that explained what I would've done if one of them was a military officer, but this is the point I woke up.

That's all I remember.

_July 17, 2025_

The dream started out with me exploring an old cargo trainyard-like place (in Gmod) set in the map, it felt somewhat creepy, but I was working on the 3rd task out of a series of tasks the map had, and my task had something to do with me going into underground areas of the map (I don't remember what the actual tasks were.)

Eventually, my dream switched to me in Minecraft, specifically in a small structure some big Minecraft Youtuber (it wasn't an actual person though) had built, which had an entrance that you had to slide on the ground to get through, which felt like a mod you needed to install, and the ground was a checkboard grid of red concrete and glowstone, with red stained glass atop the glowstone.

Similarly, there was a line of glowstone covered by red stained glass by the bottom of the walls adjacent to that of the entrance (which I'll call lights), and the rest of those walls were made of red concrete (which only went 2 blocks high), however the lights were indented by one block on the left wall, and 3 blocks on the right wall.

I realised that the right wall had a couple missing blocks of red concrete that the Youtuber accidently left out while building. I then left the structure, then the Youtuber, who had a unique avatar that wore a black buttoned business suit without a tie, but had a head that resembled the sea monster from the 1st mob vote, but only had a top and bottom for its mouth, which swallowed my whole head whole as they said something ominous (don't remember what.)

I think I woke up here but immediately fell back asleep, because literally all I remember was waking up being a bit shook, I don't even know if it was the middle of the night or if the sun was beginning to rise, though I had my curtains closed.

The last thing I remember was being in the front of my elementary school, specifically by the fencepost of the west end of the gap for the drop-off loop, where Squidward was struck down by something and said "OH MY GOD!!" in Planktons voice, while in clear agony as his eye quickly twitched around, though it was somehow sending mixed signals to me because I wasn't sure what to tell Mr. Krabs over the radio (as if he ordered on hit on Squidward, also I was speaking in Squidward's voice for whatever reason), which played out a bit like this:

Mr. Krabs: "He's in what condition?"
Me: "Good condition!"
_(bickering over the radio while constantly repeating something similar)_

I imagined Mr. Krabs told me off about being useless as I wasn't providing clear information, though it didn't play in the dream, probably because I woke up right after, satisfied that my dream had a comedic end to it.

There was also a drawing that came up before the bickering over the radio, which could be perceived as a zero that didn't line up properly at the bottom, or as a nine that didn't have its loop completed, though the only relevant thing it had with the rest of the dream was the potential for misinterpretation.

That's all I remember.

_July 20, 2025_

I had moved into a strangely massive and extensive apartment, owned by my roommate who heavily resembled my cousin Sam, but with slightly darker skin, and I didn't get the feeling that he was actually related to me (in my dream.)

The apartment was on the highest floor of the fairly tall apartment - I felt like the surrounding city was Winnipeg but I couldn't recognize any sort of landmarks - the apartment took up the entire floor which made it feel like a penthouse.

There was two outdoor areas of the apartment located next to the building's staircase on opposite ends of it, with windows at the top of the walls from the staircase which appeared to be only there to let in light, but you could see the roof of the apartment through them since they didn't have any sort of privacy blur screening installed on them. These outdoor areas could clearly see the sky, so it had to be on the top floor, and they had on nice black door with shiny yellow knobs which made them felt like the front doors of two separate identical apartments, since the structure of each half of the apartment looked the same from the outside - they had white exterior walls.

The apartment had a nice large kitchen with a tall very ceiling that seemed to be 2 stories high, the cabinets were made of light brown grainy wood with high quality black handles, the countertops were made of black granite, and there was a large kitchen island that was so big that much of it was out of arms' reach.

The apartment had two front doors from the staircase, one for either half of the apartment, and one of the front doors was in a corner of the kitchen where a mat had been placed, though the wall adjacent to that front door curved around in a rough semi-circle which obscured much of the entrance, though I imagined there was also a closet with sliding mirror doors next to it.

I used the other front door of the apartment, though I don't remember what was there, then I made my way to the kitchen through the east (from the kitchen) outdoor area.

Sunlight streamed into the kitchen's large tall white frame windows, and it had a white ceiling fan which my roommate pointed out to me after they entered through the front door in the kitchen, since it was apparently always supposed to be on. So I continued exploring to see if I could find the switch to turn them on, for some reason the kitchen also had a cramped long hall-like area that was only wide enough for two people to comfortably pass by each other, which even in my dream I felt was already unnecessary, and it had fast-food style grill tops that looked like they were simply placed onto the counter tops.

For whatever reason, my sister Mady randomly showed up out of nowhere, but paid no attention to her as I decided to press the switch on what looked like a power cord that connected to the grill tops, but it didn't turn on the ceiling fan. Now, the wall where the front door was was replaced with a large opening that led into a large room that looked to be as big as my high school's multi-purpose room (the outdoor areas also had views of the skylines, so there was really no way for me to make sense of it physically.)

The large room had the typical long industrial-looking ceiling lights, and at first glance it looked normal on its own, other than the large number of those strange blobby-shaped tables which had red tabletops, they all just barely had their own unique shape which was largely consistent besides from slight variations I noticed, and they were all set up across the room, but were spaced apart just enough to avoid feeling cramped, but would still make it a hassle to get across the room.

To the left of the opening, right along where it ended was a massive arcade style "Brazilian" Pinball Machine, which was mostly painted black except for the playing area, and it had black square grid netting along the sides, and (ignoring the nets) the bottom part almost went up to my collarbone.

Next to it on its right, past the pinball machine from where I was standing, were 2 massive Fast Food Full-on Grills, which looked like it had to be climbed onto just for it to be even remotely useable.

Mady said something about wanting to play pinball, so I found its power cord which was as big as my hand but didn't look like it was scaled up as much as the machine, I flipped its switch and the machine sprang to life as its many lights began to flash.

However, Sam told that the power cord only connected to the pinball machine and the massive grills, not the ceiling fan, and they used massive amounts of electricity which would quickly create an expensive electric bill, so I quickly turned it off.

That's all I remember.

_August 19, 2025_
My dream was of a pixel-art story game set in a laboratory that had a few police station-like room to the far left, which included a small office with an interrogation area off to the bottom of the large room, and a fairly large cell where the player character, a female with long brown hair, a white shirt, and an unzipped red jacket over it, would spawn.

The cell bed seems to be queen-sized and had an orange blanket, which was positioned along the middle of the top wall, the room had grey tiling, and the cell door which was fully open without me having to do anything was in the top right corner. The room also had a small light grey rug at the foot of the bed, where there was a white stool tipped over to its right.

The dream had first started with a capture sequence, where a brown-skinned ally with white hair and ragged clothing, tried to hold off 3 guys in black suits who were presumably sent by the lab, but we both got caught _(don't remember how it happened)_

I walked out of my cell, but I was soon blocked by 3 lab employees who were questioning the junior employee about their work, which was somehow about the actual story game itself like they themselves were the ones setting up every detail and action I could encounter.

The only way I could progress was by talking to the junior employee, though it'd cause the 3 other employees to berate them one after the other progressively lowering the junior employee's mood, but they finally moved down the hallway they were blocking, allowing me to access the office/interrogation room next to my cell.

There was a twin with white skin and short orange hair, wearing a blue police uniform and cap, who was working on their computer delaying the interrogation they were supposed to do, which was that of my ally to try and extract some sort of information from him.

I left the room, and although the 3 employees still appeared to be blocking the one-tile wide hallway _(which was 2 tiles wide where they were berating the junior employee)_, they'd run away from me in a panic whenever I approached them.

I was able to get into a large open area where I could now freely move around, which resembled a large-scale laboratory with equipment strewn all over the place.

That's all I remember.

_October 4, 2025_
I've somehow slept in 9 hours after reading a chapter of Yotsuba, but anyways:

I was in a car with Pearl with Steven Universe, but how they acted didn't match its story. She was driving down a barren highway in the middle of the night, with a powerline running along it, and was surrounded by green farmland as far as I could see.

Pearl started talking about how she was sent on a mission to Earth from some sort of Intergalactic Federation or whatever, but that's the mission has only felt like a couple years to her despite the journey just to reach Earth taking several decades at minimum, and she started having an existential crisis.

Sometime later, I was now riding my bike along a different but similar highway at fairly impressive speed, almost managing to keep up with cars that were driving past, and I eventually came across a cargo train which I began to follow: For some reason there was a closed-off track which had a road barrier that I'd see at crossing, even though they're meant for vehicles and pedestrians, which opened up almost right as the train completely passed it.

The train then stopped at a station a short distance ahead, though it was an industrial facility meant for maintenance: The Train Conductor stepped out and started asking one of the managers, who had a green safety helmet, a full body white jumpsuit, slight brown skin, and short black hair, about how they can make it to "_Boatlock_", the closed-off track they intended to turn down.

(I forgot its exact name, but "Boat" was definitely in the first half.)

Apparently, the only way the Train Conductor could reach Boatlock from where he currently was was to make a significant diversion, which led into an argument between them and the Manager.
