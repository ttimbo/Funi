This document connects the stories of Unknowable, KRUSHERS, Boy from the Kuluho, into one timeline in chronological order, starting with KRUSHERS from where two almost identical messages known as the _Eventual_ - a long in-depth message describing every documented historical tragedy in the history of humankind - are sent into two Physical Worlds with the help of the Power of Messenger - the first Spiritual Power the Creator gave to the Kuluho as a means of communication between them, by providing its holder with whatever knowledge they desired by altering their neural connections, which disregards the Laws of Physics as it manifests in the Spiritual World from the phenomenon of Absolute Random.




into one document where it can be easily assessed, organized, and explained.

| From KRUSHERS: The Eventual is sent via a concentrated beam of heat that melts descriptions of future events as a long string of binary code, into the wall of a rural home in the Russian Empire.<br><br>The beam is reflected off a mirror-based device on an open windowsill the owner used to track sunlight, allowing the Eventual to be written inside the home. | A rural Rossgivo farmer who fought for the resistance during the _1950 Civilian Revolution_ attempts to use a poison capsule of BRK-D8 he received back then, to put down a diseased calf humanely after he was met with resistance from his Son. _However the BRK-D8 seemingly had no impact_ besides inflicting internal bleeding in the calf from the glass shards, but should've most certainly been fatal. | From KRUSHERS: The Eventual - a second identical message - is sent in a similar manner as in Unknowable, but 8 years ahead in _(what would be)_ the People's Republic of China.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
