Static:
  A young adult male whose spiritual power allows him to influence the instances of _Absolute Random_, by replicating other nearby instances of it in certain places and arranging them in a specific manner to achieve a desired outcome. He doesn't know how this is determined or done, but its based off his conscious thoughts.
  
  The young man, or _"Static"_ (in reference to the randomness of TV Static - It's also what he calls his spiritual power) can use his power in the past to easily achieve a series of complex events in the present, by using a portion of the spiritual power, _Messenger_, which can create tiny physical changes in other Physical Worlds while enhanced by a recent injection of BRK-D8.
  
  The portion of the power of Messenger cannot be used by Static for any other uses, since his power of Static would overlap with it and overwhelm his spirit, and it needs to be enhanced by recent injections of BRK-D8 for his power of Static to be used in the past.
  
  Depending on the events desired to be fulfilled by the power of Static, and its impacts on the Physical World, it might not be done in the desired span of time _(ex. Too sudden, or requires certain elements that are nowhere nearby or could have any reasonable impact)_, or cannot be done at all _(ex. Supernovas, Sudden Disintegration, Changes to the laws of the Physical World)_


A young adult women who's spiritual power of Spiritual Transfer allows her to freely transfer her spirit in and out of the physical world, provided her body is still functional, in a sort of 'death' which it technically is albeit can be easily reversed.

The issues with Blood Purity, which normally makes identifying spiritual powers difficult as the reintroduction of foreign DNA prevents previous holders from providing the knowledge of it, gets bypassed entirely by the power of Spiritual Transfer, allowing current holders to speak with previous holders directly.

The power of Spiritual Transfer was previously used to convict countless murderers with certainty by a female lawyer who spoke with the victims in the Spirit World, to the point that she was investigated to see if she doing such convictions as a form of backstabbing.



KRUSHERS Ideas:
 * Playing everyday board games to keep people sane
 * A large book released yearly, full of short stories by kids from across Rossgivo, with story slots that gradually get more expensive the closer to the start of the book they are.

KRUSHERS: Beyond

After Kinn, Gabriel, Gavis, and the last 2 members of The Scouts escape the GCO Exclusion Zone, with Ruiz having sacrificed himself, Don turning into a Gear and being defeated by Gabriel, who was revealed to be wielding the spiritual power of Reconstruction. Now, they all have to readjust to life among those who never witnessed the same horrors they had, which creates a noticeable and eerie divide between the refugees and the survivors.

Since Gabriel became an orphan, Kinn - who didn't want to him to fall into the hands of Trey's abusive father, especially with the mysterious powers he holds - adopted Gabriel so he could care for him.

Gavis reunited with his children, so did the last 2 surviving members of The Scouts.

_Ideas:_
* Gabriel uses his power to remove the cancer out of a young classmate's body.
* Jeremy Torrik's original motives, and what led them to discover the Kuluho's spiritual powers are revealed.
* A deep contrast between refugees and survivors, with survivors more closed-off and somber due to their trauma, one that fades away between young kids because of their innocence.
* Roxia's efforts in refugee aid and fighting back against Krushers.
* The last surviving territory of Rossgivo in the south, and on Nicholas' Island, along with the remnants of the government.





I had a dream of a world suddenly getting overrun by giant monsters, through the perspective of 3 young kids who all specifically had 1 year, 113 days, 3 hours, and 5 minutes left to live, who almost all got killed by a monster on the third day, but were saved by a mysterious man.

Boy from the Kuluho
  Kelsey is revealed to have Spiritual Powers, by subconsciously unloading the guns of _Hunters_ using the power of _Energy Manipulation, which Tal recognized as a **spiritual power**_, but Jeremy needed to explain how guns work, before Tal could specify _which power_ it was, because the technology it had affected were _completely foreign to the Kuluho_.
  
  Kelsey first used _EM_ during their 2nd escape attempt of Eon by breaking a keycard reader, _hoping it would unlock a door, subconsciously unlocking the door herself using EM_.
  
  
  
  _The power of Messenger_ was the first spiritual power obtained by the Kuluho, as a way for them to communicate with the Creator, which its first holder was informed of, and passed the knowledge onto others, hence the name "Messenger".
  
  It works by 'sifting' through the brains of all humans that have ever existed, and creates the necessary neural connections to allow the holder to complete virtually any task they wish, as well as providing an idea of the outcome for each possible decision, to the point where it feels like it really did just occur.
  
  
  and allowed for technological development despite centuries of total isolation, worked by  (_In Unknowable, Neil Gray, being a descendant of the Kuluho, gained the power from the previous holder, who had planned it out so that Neil could fix their own world_.)
   This power informed the Kuluho's first settlers of the Creator


_KRUSHERS_ 
 Walls attack anything that moves, so travelling on days with strong winds is very dangerous because of their unpredictable attacks; even attacking things that aren't alive.
 
 Decades old Theme Park setting, with many of its truss-supported rollercoasters still intact, provides a false sense of hope before a large-scale ambush by Krushers - _Setting Idea_

 Train and Rail tracks entirely covered in overgrowth after years of decay - _Setting Idea_

 Festival, set up right before an emergency evacuation and was never taken down - _Setting Idea_

 Jewelry Store, Ruiz closely examines a wedding ring before taking it with him - _Setting_



"Eggs are great children to eat" - said someone in Entry Point lobby server (forgot to screenshot it)

Idea thought of when trying to incorporate 'Spider Game'

Interstellar Space Force (band of like 6 people) recruits a person with the ability to make their shadow puppets come to life, but there's a catch; They're only 6 years old.
