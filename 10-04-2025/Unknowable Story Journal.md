**Soviet Tragedy Prevention and Reduction (STPR)**
 A secret government organization created by the USSR solely to protect its own ideals, silence any threats to the USSR, and/or to the organization itself.
 
 A message seemingly sent by Devine intervention in 1897, to the rural farmlands of Russia, would lay the groundworks for the STPR, as the message had provided a long, in-depth list of future tragedies from all across the world, most of which would now be entirely preventable.

 The Russian Government became aware of this message in 1915, after the death of Kamil, who revealed the existence, and true nature of the message in his dying moments. However the message wasn't seen as valuable information until 1919, when a historian realised many of its predictions had actually occurred, 1:1, despite having certainly been written _way_ before then.

**Neil Greyson**
 Caucasian, Asexual, Male, born in 1990, grew up in a small city within the Great Plains.
 
 He almost always wears a black ring on his right middle finger to represent his asexuality, which inadvertently acted as an object for a spiritual connection and allowed Neil to use the power of Messenger.
 
 Witnessed the attempted murder of Garry Helms in May 2000, orchestrated by the **Soviet Tragedy Prevention and Reduction (STPR)** committed by operative, and eventual founder of the **International Organization for Tragedy Prevention and Avoidance (IOTPA)** Big Regrets.
 _(IOTPA Founder's placeholder name)_ Despite Garry being struck in the head with a large metal object, and quickly bleeding, he was conscious enough to plea for help from Neil, a plea which Neil didn't act upon out of fear, seemingly ignoring it because of the bullying from Garry, a decision which Neil deeply regrets as Garry might've survived had Neil informed a nearby houseowner of the incident, who would've at least called for Emergency Services.

 Moved to New York City in June 2000, as his Father was offered a better position in the city, and Neil's parent hoped that moving away would help delay a probable early onset of depression.


**Big Regrets (IOTPA Founder) (Placeholder name)**
 Caucasian, Male, born in 1962, grew up in the USSR.
 
 His devoted loyalty to the Motherland, his high intellect, along with his experience in hand to hand combat, and close quarters combat, both of which he had earned during his involvement in the [[Soviet-Afghan War]].

 In May 2000, he attempted to murder Garry Helms but was interrupted by Neil, and quickly fled the scene to avoid capture, but Garry presumably bled to death, since the threat he'd eventually pose to the Motherland, never occurred.


**Abigail (Pretend Girlfriend of Neil)**
 Caucasian, Female, born into a rich family, she's constantly guarded by bodyguards because "a Hitman got ahold of her full name, decades before she was born", but instead believes it to be the actions of a manipulative scammer, wanting part of her family's fortune.
 
 Abigail attends the same University as Neil, who agreed to act as her Boyfriend so she wouldn't be constantly harassed by bodyguards while he's with her.
 

**Garry Helms (Neil's childhood best friend)**
 Caucasian, Male, born in 1989, attended the same school as Neil, who he was friends with.

 In May 2000, while walking home from school, STPR Operative "Big Regrets" pulled Garry into a back alley (between rows of houses) Garry desperately fought back long enough for Neil to walk by, and notice the events unfolding. Just then, the operative struck Garry in the head with a large metal object before fleeing the scene, unable to stand and heavily bleeding, he begged Neil to help him, but Neil was too frightened and fled, only telling his dad about the incident hours later.
