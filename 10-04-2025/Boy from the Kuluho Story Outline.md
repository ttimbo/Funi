_The Kuluho_ are a remote, isolated village, located inside the giant rainforest ("**Tusko Rainforest**"), a counterpart to the isolated villages of the **Amazon Rainforest**. First arriving in the 1400s, they've remained largely isolated, only being contacted by people from the outside world in 1923, which the Kuluho call "_Other People_".

Because of the Kuluho's isolation, breeding with foreign groups was virtually nonexistent...

The settlers call of which themselves the "**Kuluho**", and hold a generational ceremony to pass on the **spiritual energy hidden within them**:

  5 villagers between the ages of 20 to 55 years are handpicked by the village Elders to be the new carriers of this spiritual energy.
  
  During a lunar eclipse, all 5 carriers are escorted to the Kuluho's sacred pole, a tall wooden pole erected by founders of the Kuluho's village, 500 years prior.
  
  A village Elder with complete control over this spiritual energy, pricks the left hand of each new Holder, and their own, releasing a drop of their own blood into each Holders' bloodstream, which unlocks the spiritual energy within them.

It is believed that performing the ceremony during a lunar eclipse provides a greater connection into the spiritual realm, where all spirits reside when their powers aren't being called upon in the natural world, however this greater spiritual connection is merely formed by the belief alone.

Unbeknownst to the villagers, the unlocking of this spiritual energy is caused by the poisoning of a substance designated **BRK-D8**, a hazardous liquid that causes Brain Death less than a day after getting into a person's bloodstream _(this can be passed through the blood of an infected person.)_

The Kuluho are immune to its fatal effects, as their village's remoteness has prevented breeding with foreign groups, and thus prevented significant DNA mutations.

The natural form of BRK-D8 comes from the plant "**Deth Purplis**", a tall spiky-looking plant, with bulb-shaped purple tips, from where it excretes BRK-D1 as a poisonous liquid to defend itself against natural predators.

Deth Purplis is native to the Tusko Rainforest, and considered mostly harmless. However, imports of Deth Purplis are banned or restricted in most countries, as BRK-D1 can be manufactured into BRK-D8, which can quickly lead to Brain Death after infecting a person's bloodstream.




The intended purpose of BRK-D8 is to allow one to contact supernatural spirits, an ability that can let one use spiritual powers in the natural world, but its exact effects vary depending on how uniform and pure one's DNA is:
If one's DNA has been passed down at least 10 generations without foreign breeding, or is related to an ancestor who has and enough of their DNA was been passed down to meet an equivalent of these requirements, then the poisoning of BRK-D8 won't lead to Brain Death, as it's caused by an overload of spiritual connections from different spirits, of which the Human Brain can only handle one at a time _(although it's theoretically possible to switch between different connections to prevent stimuli overload, this hasn't been done successfully by a Human before.)_

This spiritual connection is further strengthened if one's DNA has been passed down additional generations without the introduction of foreign DNA, which the Kuluho had done for at least the past 30 generations, as the founders of the Kuluho were already immune to the effects of BRK-D8 in 1400s, and would remain isolated for the next 20 generations.

[[Kuluho Character Journal]]


Taking place after the story of **Unknowable**, this story follows the same basic premise, however this time the message is sent from the Unknowable Universe, arriving in 1905 China, providing proper instructions to prevent and avoid every Eventual Event involved in Unknowable, strongly urging for **Rehabilitation** rather than Assassination of key players of future Eventual Events.


**Project Hawk** aims to accomplish this goal of rehabilitation, started in 1915 and beginning operations in 1919, led by the People's Republic of China, Project Hawk is an international coordinated effort by 40 countries (which excludes the US, UK, Western Europe, most of Africa due to its under development, and some parts of Asia) meant to steer key players of Eventual Events away from potential Butterfly Effects that could lead to it, a goal kept entirely secret from them.

To do this, special facilities codenamed "**Specialized Rehabilitation Education Facilities**" or "**SREF**" were built to closely monitor, house, and influence '_Causers of the Eventual_' away from Eventual Events, who are released once the date of their Eventual Event passes without incident.

Each facility is made distinct with a unique codename, one of them being "**Eon**", established in 1947, located 20km inland of Taiwan, notorious for its inhumane '_rehabilitation_' practices, typically justified by inadequate research papers, or none at all.

The practices that take place at Eon, but aren't universal across other SREFs, include:
 24 hour Solitary Confinement
 Induced Starvation via limitations on daily Food Intake
 Forced labour
 Brainwashing

Eon is an enclosed complex of various 1 to 4 level buildings vaguely resembling a city, divided into different sections for different forms of education, for ages 6 to 18 years, along with places of work for those still kept at _Eon_ after finishing their education.

Surrounded by plain 20 metre tall concrete walls, and similar 15 metre tall walls dividing different sections of Eon, and security checkpoints at every passageway between them, but the checkpoints are only necessary for those aged 13 years and older. The prison-like feel of Eon still tries to be minimized while keeping _Causers of the Eventual_ confined and closely monitored.

To keep _Causers of the Eventual_ hidden, and provide a fa√ßade for Eon's true purpose, admission into Eon isn't optional for them, however Eon is still used as an educational facility to get kids accustomed to modern-day life, and most Students attend Eon by choice, who aren't nearly as monitored or influenced by Eon's Staff, just enough for Causers of the Eventual not to notice.

Due to most future Eventual Events not having an exact cause provided, most of those labelled as Causers of the Eventual would've merely coincided with them, or not at all, and only a few dozen of the nearly 4,000 defined as such, clearly listed as having an actual role in future Eventual Events.

Because of this, many of the people held at Eon, that wouldn't've played a role in Eventual Events, even without Project Hawk to influence them, ended up becoming more violent and aggressive caused by the years they spent at Eon, resulting in the formation of a small paramilitary force, dedicated to freeing those that are still being held at Eon.

The process of admission into Eon, for Causers of the Eventual:
