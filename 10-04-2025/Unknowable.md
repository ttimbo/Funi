**A story of how preventing certain events from occurring, according to a prophecy-like message known as the Eventual which outlines exact details of future tragedies as if it was sent from the future for that purpose, but when it requires making sacrifices for the greater good, it can be perceived as unjustifiably harmful to outside observers who wouldn’t ever know of why they had to be done.**

The concept for Unknowable was first envisioned May 2024, its name was originally shortened from Unknowable Motives, but later on it had broader connections to the story beyond motives.

The idea came to mind based on the Grandfather Paradox, specifically a different interpretation on the Internet, where a Time Traveler could've killed Hitler as a baby to prevent WW2, which either couldn't ever succeed if they still had that motive in the future, or creates a new timeline.

I thought of it as not causing a paradox, but rather leading to a new timeline of events where the death of Adolf Hitler is a long forgotten case of Infanticide, and the people who would've died in WW2 had went about their daily lives without ever knowing of what they avoided.

Hypothetically, a similar scenario could've also just barely been avoided in our world, such as a random motor accident killing a person that would've been a key player in a long butterfly effect, with their death either preventing a major tragedy, or far more likely killing an innocent civilian who at worst, might've not yet had the motives or skills to continue the butterfly effect.

In Unknowable, the idea of necessary sacrifices is disconnected by the Eventual, which predicts future events with almost near-certainly that denying the usage of time travel is more absurd, but makes the sacrifices feel more ruthless since the people involved wouldn't ever see the events that would occur otherwise, as if they're being made to kill seemingly innocent children who would've apparently killed a great number of people had they lived longer.

This is what causes the founder of IOTPA to betray the STPR...

#1 | A Painful Memory (8/25/2025)
  Neil Greyson, currently depicted as a cheerful 9 year old Elementary student, races his best friend Garry Helms on their way back home after school.
  
  Suddenly, Garry turns and goes down a seemingly random alley between the rows of houses, and the mood gets more off-putting as Garry doesn't respond when Neil tries to call out to him, however it seems like Garry stopped just around the corner of the tall fences, since Neil doesn't hear the scamper of Garry's footsteps which have abruptly ceased.
  
  Reasonably confused, Neil checks the alley to see what Garry is doing, but discovers that Garry slumped onto the ground, _heavily bleeding from the head where he had been struck by an unknown man wielding a baton_, something that must've occurred moments prior however there wasn't any indication of a struggle or even the baton strike from Neil's perspective, despite his very close proximity.
  
  The unknown man, who's most certainly the perpetrator, is depicted as being almost entirely harshly scribbled out in a sort of child-like manner, except for two empty white areas on their head that appear to be meant as their eyes, and appears to have a masculine figure.
  
  The sight of this scene deeply frightens Neil as he's frozen in place from shock, while the perpetrator seemingly disappears right in front of him as shown by a different perspective where the man should still be clearly visible but is now completely absent.
  
  As Neil remains frozen, Garry slowly regains consciousness and manages to lift his head up, but is clearly barely clinging onto life. Garry calls out to Neil as loud as he can muster, begging for Neil to help him, and although Neil appears to take a while to regain his composure, it conflicts with his inner thoughts where he wants to help Garry immediately but his body refuses to move.
  
  Eventually, Neil walks over and tries to reach his hand out to Garry's, but the ground between them suddenly breaks apart creating a figurative chasm - indicating that what has unfolded is the result of childhood trauma - which puts them both just out of reach of each other, as Garry continues to whimper out Neil's name while the chasm gradually pulls them further apart.
  
  
  Suddenly, the tone abruptly shifts as Garry seemingly slaps Neil, but it's promptly revealed to be Neil's University roommate waking him up from what was a nightmare, albeit in a somewhat questionable manner.
  
  The nightmare seems to have been caused by Neil's childhood trauma, though his roommate doesn't know anything of it as even when Neil is clearly sweating from the stress, his roommate is seemingly only concerned about Neil potentially missing one of his course lectures which start in half an hour, however Neil doesn't think much of it as he's lost in his thoughts.
  
  There's a time skip to when Neil arrives late to the lecture: He has black hair short on the front but long on the back, his bedhead is gone though his hair is mostly the same, he wears a light grey hoodie, black pants, a black ring on his right middle finger, and has a noticeably slim black backpack compared to the other nearby students' who briefly glance over at Neil as he walks in.
  
  Neil questions the purpose of such behaviour, possibly being from people's curiosity since he figures it wouldn't be an attempt to shame random people they'll probably never interact with, though doesn't make much sense to pull their attention away from their education which they're actively paying for, but his inner thoughts are interrupted as the Professor who purposefully shifts a question he was about to bring up onto Neil since he came in late.
  
  Even so, Neil quickly scans over the projection on the large chalkboard, and answers the question fairly easily, having studied the same material a few nights prior so that'd he have extra time to do _something else_, however it isn't specified as to what it is.
  
  After the lecture, Neil heads off to the library wanting to read up on history, specifically "_The War in the Pacific_" which seems to be about the Pacific Theater of WW2, however somebody bumps into him causing him to drop the book, which annoys Neil a bit but he initially brushes it off until he realises that his wallet also somehow fell out of his deep pant pockets, potentially being a failed pickpocket that the person is attempting to inconspicuously distance themselves from.
  
  Now suspicious, Neil uses his flip phone to take a picture of the person: One of two large men who are currently escorting a young female student out of the library, a detail that causes Neil to try and chase after them as it increases his suspicion even further, but they're already long gone when Neil exits the library.
  
  Neil brings up the incident to the main office, though its apparently been a somewhat common occurrence as other people have done the same, but the only thing they're allowed to share about the student is that those men are _personal bodyguards_, which they cannot delve into the exact reasoning for though Neil just assumes that she's from a rich overprotective family.
  
  When Neil returns to his shared apartment, he only then realises that he left the history book back at the library which has already now closed, but Neil just decides to go back for it tomorrow as he wanted to check out the book simply out of his own curiosity.
  
  Bored, Neil tries to ask his roommate if he has any history books, though since his roommate is majoring in _Aviation_, the closest thing he has to it is a thin book about different types of planes that he got for his birthday as a kid, which he lends to Neil but not without questioning him as to why he chooses to read up on history if he's majoring in _Business_, or at the very least why he doesn't instead read objectively more entertaining fictional novels, though Neil gives a vague answer stating that he finds history more fascinating.
  
  As Neil expected, the book contains short descriptions about broad types of planes which go on for about a page or two, though he's only knowledgeable enough to tell it's the case for the first couple types. 
  
  The book separates the purpose for different types of planes into different categories, one such category that gets Neil's attention is "_War Planes_", so he begins flipping through the pages to try and find a specific type: _Kamikaze Planes_.
  
  Neil finds the entry, which has understandably had most of its details toned down to suit a children's book, but the concept of Kamikaze planes itself certainly couldn't be mentioned, as is evident from the book calling the planes "_single use_", and that they were loaded with a large amount of weaponry since they "_weren't meant to return_", which most accurately describes them without twisting certain details and instead using broad meanings that aren't as explicit.
  
  
  When Neil tries to sleep that night, he gets a similar nightmare from the previous night, and decides that he should seek out a therapist during the day.
  
  In the morning, Neil ventures off-campus to a nearby therapist only a 5 minute walk away, but also means that it's frequently used by the students so the closest available session Neil can book is 2 days away, though he chooses to stick with the place regardless.
  
  After some (story-wise) unimportant lectures, Neil goes out during the evening once more to visit a nearby restaurant-like fast food burger chain, which is supposedly higher quality than what he was used to back in the US because of the higher European standards it has to meet.
  
  Along the way, Neil spots a purse snatcher heading his direction, and although he could simply ignore it 



Breakthrough (6/29/2024)
 
 It is December of 2008, over 8 years since Neil had witnessed the homicide of his best friend, Garry Helms.

 Despite Neil only being 10 years old at the time, and Garry having constantly bullied him back then, Neil still feels guilty about the fact Garry, in his dying moments, would've seen him ignore his cries for help, and probably thought it was due to his relentless bullying of Neil, when in actuality Neil was just scared.

 Since then, Neil has visited countless therapists, and despite the police's best efforts, most of the information they concluded with had came from Neil himself.

 The area's local Police Department closed the case in 2005, concluding that the murder of Garry Helms was planned, supported by the large amounts of Garry's blood discovered in an alleyway, directly along a route he frequently took, to and from school.
 
 This was further supported by the testimony of an anonymous witness (Neil) but the trail went cold afterwards, since Garry Helms's body was never located, his death was never confirmed.

 Now, Neil is attending his first year at a prestigious European University, in Grayson, Rossgivo.

 After a day of the usual introductory classes, Neil heads to the large, two story library, to check out textbooks relevant to his studies. While there, Neil decides to take the chance to browse the library's catalog before he's too busy working on assignments to do so.

 As Neil explores the library, books in hand, he goes through a narrow passage between the shelfs and is pushed off-balance by someone passing by, making him drop the books. Neil quickly looks to see who pushed him: 2 large, muscular men, pushing a 3rd person forward who he can't get a good look of.

 But Neil doesn't think much of it, and starting picking the books off the ground, only then does he realise his wallet fell out of his pocket, after finding it on the ground. Neil suspects the group of three to be pick pocketers, and quickly takes a picture of them with his flip phone as they're leaving the library: All 3 people are Caucasian, and the two men seem to be in their late 30s, early 40s, while the 3rd person is a girl with shoulder length black hair, likely the same age as Neil.

 Neil soon realises how incriminating the picture looks, and tries to go after the group, but they're already long gone once he gets to where he last saw them. Not wanting what might be a serious problem to go unnoticed, he reports the two men to a Staff member, who merely sighs and explains that the two men are the girl's personal bodyguards, but doesn't give out any additional information for the sake of privacy.

 Back at his dorm, Neil figures one of the bodyguards was simply frisking him for weapons, but before rationalizing a logical reason why, he starts wondering why the girl even has bodyguards to begin with, especially in crowded place like a university campus.

 Since it's only his first day on campus, he figures the girl just has overprotective rich parents, and doesn't go out of his way to figure out more information.

 A week later, Neil is looking for a new therapist close to campus, and finds once within walking distance. While heading over there in person, Neil bumps into the girl with the bodyguards, but only now is she completely alone.

 Neil uses the chance to get to know the girl, who introduces herself as Abagail, she's a bit shy, but eventually explains she's _heading to a local tea shop (Lie)_ Neil decides to accompany Abagail on her trip to the tea shop, since he didn't feel the need to seek therapy for the time being. Abagail is flustered by this, but she agrees, as long as it's apparent they aren't in a relationship.

 At the tea shop, Abagail brings up the incident at the library, and asks Neil if he "likes her" because he was taking pictures of her, to which Neil explains he was taking pictures, not of her, but of her bodyguards, since he had mistaken them for being pick pocketers. 

 Abagail stays silent for a couple seconds, before asking Neil why he thought they were pick pocketers, and he starting explaining the incident from his perspective. That leads into a conversation about who they are, why they're attending the university, and their goals in life. 

 Eventually, Abagail asks Neil about his childhood, which reminds him of Garry Helms's murder. 
 
 Neil doesn't respond.


_Revelation P1 (5/21/2024)_

  Sometime in the 1897, in the rural farmlands of Russia, a young man in his personal office, sketches out blueprints for a new invention, when an unnaturally bright sunray hits a piece of reflective machinery near an open window, reflecting onto a wall filled with pinned blueprints and written documents, which it begins to burn.

  The man quickly notices, shoves away the chair he’s sitting in, and after accidentally burning himself while investigating the sunray, goes to move the reflective machinery away from the window.

  The man gets distracted by the fact the sunray doesn’t originate anywhere near the Sun, but a seemingly random spot in the sky. Suddenly, the sunray starts moving erratically, and once the man turns around, the scorch marks have legibly formed the words “GREETING TO WHOMEVER RECEIVES THIS MESSAGE”.

  The man freaks out, and instinctively backs away, shifting the table behind him slightly. The sunray returns and writes “LEAVE EVERYTHING AS IS” a small cylindrical piece of wood rolls off the table the man had shifted, but he catches it before it hits the ground. “PROPER DELIVERY OF THIS MESSAGE RELIES ON THESE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES”. The man returns the wood to its original position.

  _“WE DON'T EXPECT A RESPONSE.”_

  _“THE REMAINDER OF THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN ENCODED, AS ITS LENGTH DOES NOT ALLOW IT TO BE WRITTEN IN A LEGIBLE MANNER.”_
  
  Sequences of dots and dashes (binary code) are quickly written in a much smaller size, only ceasing as the Sun begins to set, and the man having calmed himself down, waiting for the message to conclude.
  
  _“DELIVERY OF THIS MESSAGE HAS NOW CEASED, FAREWELL”_ is the last thing written before the sunray disappears.

  The man shuts the window, then closes the blinds.

_Revelation P2 (5/27/2024)_

  The man runs into a bar, wearing the blue leather coat that was hanging in his office, and meets up with a friend. The man is introduced as “Kamil”, and his friend “Peloskiv”. Kamil takes out a small, worn out, metal lunch box, opens it, and hands Peloskiv a sizable chunk of the papers hidden within.

  Peloskiv questions Kamil about the validity, and origin, of the text, to which Kamil replies as possibly being a message from the Gods. This surprises Peloskiv, since Kamil had never made any previous mention of a brief in Gods, which Kamil quickly clarifies as merely being an assumption.

  Kamil tells Peloskiv about the message having been written by a beam of bright light, burning the message into his office wall, and invites Peloskiv over to see for himself.

  (Kamil’s home office)

  Peloskiv stares blankly at the scorched message, upon closer inspection, just as Kamil thinks he believes him, Peloskiv asks if it could be a prank from the locals.

  Kamil is distraught by this, since Peloskiv might’ve been able to decrypt the rest of the message, and being unable to provide further evidence, Peloskiv instead promises to help find the perpetrators of the property damage, then leaves.

  (Kamil’s bedroom)

  Kamil lays in his bed during a rainy night. Unable to fall asleep, he takes out the lunch box, hidden inside a drawer next to his bed, then looks back at the documentation. Kamil gradually searches more thoroughly, before realising Peloskiv hadn’t returned his portion of the documentation Kamil gave him.

  (Kamil’s living room, morning time, and a while after Peloskiv had returned the missing documentation)

  Peloskiv chats with Kamil about something unrelated to recent events, eventually Peloskiv asks about the “Sun Follower”, revealed by Kamil to be the device which the beam of light had reflected off, into his office.

  Peloskiv pauses for a moment, then asks Kamil how he knows that detail.
  
_Revelation P3 (5/29/2024)_

  (Kamil’s home office, after Kamil told Peloskiv, he witnessed the message being written.)

  Peloskiv stares at the non encoded sections of the message, pondering how the exact placement of the message could’ve been planned if a recipient might’ve not been expected, who sent the message and for what reason, or how the rest of the message is supposed to be decrypted.

  Kamil brings up the possibility of Aliens sending the message, which Peloskiv quickly rejects, but admits to not having any leads on who might’ve sent the message.

  Peloskiv then looks at the encoded sections, making a comment about its tiny, compact size, before noticing 2 very similar strings, and several more instances of it, all in close proximity to each other. Peloskiv tells Kamil to mark them down, as it could be helpful for decrypting the message.

  (after identifying the exact string being repeated)

  Kamil divides the repeated strings from the rest of the message with chalk markings. While doing so, Peloskiv notices all the marked strings, except the highest string which he marked himself, have the last character as a dash instead of a dot.

  Peloskiv informs Kamil of this detail, but Kamil insists to have properly marked the strings, even ignoring other nearly identical strings which were above, and below the properly marked strings. Peloskiv realises the strings further below have the 2nd to last character as a dash, while the strings further above have it as a dot.

  (It’s binary code, which allowed the message to be compacted immensely, but wasn't invented yet in the 1890s.)

  Peloskiv figures it's a pattern of some sort, possibly something integral or important to the message, since it only has minor differences between one another, in heavy contrast to the rest of the message.  

  Kamil suggests they should start from the beginning, but Peloskiv points out they wouldn’t be able to differentiate between different words, before realising the message had, so far, been written legibly, and grammatically. Peloskiv then gets the idea to look for patterns of common word usage.

  (Montage)
  
  Over the course of several days, Peloskiv analyzes the message, trying to decrypt it. Eventually, Kamil asks if he even has a job, Peloskiv replies he’s already well off, but suddenly cuts it off before explaining any further.

  Peloskiv just discovered that by translating numbers, into unique, 2 character sequences, decrypts the nearly identical strings, the highest strings translate into “1899”, then continues with an addition by 1, as it goes further down the list.

  Although the method wouldn’t have worked with letters, Peloskiv decides to divide the encoded message into 6 character long strings, in accordance with the decoded strings having the same length, then checks to see if it’s a form of substitution.

   (Substitution: reassigning letters to be used in place of other letters)
   
_Revelation P4 (6/1/2024)_

  (After decrypting the rest of the message, now sitting at Kamil’s small dining table)

  Most of the message is a long series of future events, from 1899 till 2749, providing a short overview of each event itself. Kamil and Peloskiv are unsure whether or not the events will truly occur, but both decide to keep the message a secret.

  Kamil takes the decoded message, puts it into the lunch box, then hides it in a cardboard box, at the back of his closet.

  Many years later, in 1907, Kamil is cleaning out his closet and rediscovers the decoded message. Kamil is in the process of moving out of his house, hoping to find a better life in the city, but he suddenly stops packing up his things and takes a closer look at the message.

  Believing to have recognized one of the events listed, he takes out an old newspaper that was being used to protect fragile vases, which are inside a box, and compares the headline story against the event overview. It matches up perfectly.

  Not wanting the message to be lost, Kamil contacts his old friend, Peloskiv, to hold onto the message, and whenever able, look through old records to see if the preceding events occurred as well.

  Peloskiv takes a while to remember what Kamil is talking about, but upon realising 2 of the events supposedly led to the deaths of several million people, one of which would occur in only 7 years, he accepts the offer.

  (Peloskiv, analyzing the events listed, and comparing them against archived records, in his small city apartment)

  Peloskiv is marking down the events that have occurred since then, some played out differently, or don’t have any records, but the rest perfectly match their overviews.

  All of this convinces Peloskiv the events listed are certain to occur, but since he already knows about future events, they might be preventable. Though upon noticing a relatively close-by earthquake would occur in 3 weeks, and considering it could just be an overly-elaborate prank by Kamil, Peloskiv decides to wait until then before taking the message for granted.

  Some time later, Peloskiv contacts Kamil to notify him of his findings, revealing the upcoming earthquake in 3 weeks, and promises to notify Kamil if the event really does occur, as he’ll be moving far away from the epicenter. Then he hangs up.

_Revelation P5 (6/1/2024)_

  It’s been over a month since Kamil has last heard from Peloskiv, because of the massive distance between him and the epicenter, Kamil wouldn't have been impacted by the earthquake, however he hasn't received any news coverage, or even heard of the event whatsoever.
 
  Kamil figures Peloskiv is busy with whatever job he has, and hadn't contacted him because the earthquake didn’t occur. And since Kamil duplicated the documentation for Peloskiv to have on hand, he isn't expecting Peloskiv to return it either.

  Kamil decides to contact Peloskiv himself, initially to ask about the earthquake, but after thinking it over, opts to try keeping in touch with Peloskiv, as he's the only other person he knows of who might believe the decade old message to be genuine.

  Kamil attempts to use a payphone, but discovers that Peloskiv isn't answering at all, despite calling him on a weekend which he knows are days Peloskiv doesn't work on.
  
  Kamil tries calling Peloskiv again the following day, repeatedly failing to get ahold of him, before finally calling the front desk of Peloskiv's apartment building, who inform Kamil that Peloskiv had left 3 days prior to the earthquake, and hasn't returned since.

  The Receptionist then asks Kamil if Peloskiv travels for work, given the fact Kamil specifically asked about his current whereabouts, since "the recent earthquake had severely damaged much of the Rail Network, which might've stranded him in a nearby town, or city."  
  
  Kamil worriedly asks for the exact date the earthquake in question had occurred. The date provided by the Receptionist is the date of which the nearby earthquake in the documentation was meant to occur.
  
  Kamil immediately drops the phone, leaving it hanging and not stopping the call, hurriedly running off into the distance.
