Unknowable starts in 2009, following the story of 18 year old, Neil, who was deeply traumatised during his childhood. While attending a prestigious University in the fictional city of Grayson, Germany, Neil runs into the unusual sight of 2 bodyguards, guarding a typical, female student.

Out of curiosity, Neil takes the opportunity to ask the girl about her bodyguards, after finding her alone a week later. The girl, who's name is Abigail, says her parents are overprotective and were worried about her living alone in a different country, but after Neil gets to know more about Abigail over the following weeks, they eventually become good friends.

During that time, **Neil says he grew up in New York City.**
 This is a bit of a lie, Neil _moved_ to New York City in June 2000, despite already being 10 years old at the time. Neil avoided mentioning his hometown as he didn't want to be constantly reminded of the traumatic childhood event he now has to endure for the rest of his life.

One day, while Neil and Abigail are alone, as Abigail has convinced her family that Neil wasn't a threat under the guise of him being her boyfriend, Abigail suggests they share a personal secret they've been keeping from one other.

Neil shares his traumatic childhood experience with Abigail, which he begins second guessing since Abigail was probably going to confess her secret love for him or something, instead she tells Neil the actual reason she's even guarded by bodyguards, was because apparently, "a Hitman had ahold of her entire full name, decades before she was born."

Neil tells Abigail not to joke around, since his traumatic experience is completely genuine, and she admits to not believing it either, and thinks someone is taking advantage of her parents, likely because of their vast wealth, in exchange for money.

Afterwards, Abigail returns to her personal safehouse, and relays what happened on her 'date' back to her family.
 Her family then passes the information onto an undercover investigator, who is secretly using them to gain information from Neil since he could provide a vital clue for a 50 year old case, concerning an organization called "**STPR**", which Neil had likely seen the actions of up close, and possibly along with the identity of its sole or one of many conspirators.
 
 After realising Neil had been keeping a personal secret from his childhood, something Abigail only shared and nothing more than that, to try and quell the demands of her parents since Neil specifically stated **not** to share his secret with other people, the investigator decided to pursue the lead and try to meet with Neil in person.

The next day, Neil is in the middle of studying when he gets a call from an unknown number. Assuming it's a scam caller, Neil answers it just to mess with them, and his suspicion is further supported when the caller immediately asks him if he's Neil, to which Neil nonchalantly replies "No, This is Patrick", then hangs up.

When the same caller calls back a few seconds later, Neil decides to mess with them even further, but instead of telling him his bank account was comprised or something, the caller suddenly tells Neil to meet up with him in person, as Neil likely has knowledge of some immensely important information which could be useful for the both of them.

It takes the caller nearly half an hour to convince Neil to go along with the meet up, eventually they settle on a day and an exact location.

A week later, Neil is in a large, crowded shopping mall, looking around for someone.

Neil figures the caller is never going to show up, but just as he's about to leave, he spots a man with a unique set of characteristics the caller had told him to be on the lookout for.

Neil talks with the man, who reveals themselves to be the caller. They leave the mall through a side entrance, but Neil refuses to go beyond the parking lot unless the man tells Neil who he is, what kind of "immensely important" information Neil could possibly have, and why he seems to already know who he is.

The man reveals himself to be an private investigator for a cold case, and that Neil could provide a vital clue for the investigation, however Neil needs to truthfully answer questions concerning his childhood beforehand for any additional information to be disclosed...

**INCIDENT REVEALED LATER IN THE STORY**
 When Neil was only 10 years old, in the year 2000, he had a school bully named "**Garry Helms**".

 One day, when Neil had to walk home later than expected because he almost forgot to bring home his Gym Clothes so they could be washed, Neil accidentally interrupted the planned murder plot of Garry Helms, and the preparator noticed this and hurriedly struck Garry on the head with a strange metallic object, causing Garry to immediately collapse, before running off. Neil was deeply frightened by this, but as he too starts running off, Garry who's now covered in his own blood, desperately pleas to Neil for help.

 Since Neil was still in a state of panic, he barely acknowledge this plea, and didn't tell anyone what had happened until the following day, but by that time the body of Garry Helms had already been disposed of, likely by the preparator.

â€¦Since than, Neil has always blamed himself for what he did.

The investigator expresses remorse for Neil, but tells him the information he provided wouldn't help the investigation, and thus he cannot explain why he wanted to question Neil to begin with.

After returning to his dorm, Neil realises the investigator must've already known about the incident, since he only asked about Neil's childhood, and immediately left after Neil told him everything he remembered about it, so it likely connects back to the investigation somehow.

Greatly intrigued by this realization, Neil reflects back on the incident, now remembering how a mundane task was what gotten him caught up in the incident, which if he had simply waited to do, his life could've played out much differently.

Suddenly, Neil hears a strange sound, before all five of his senses 'cuts out', that's the best Neil can describe it, like a blackout cutting off electricity to a building's lights, or is that what death is?

Panicking, all five of his senses come back to him moments later, still alive, and too real to be a dream. This has never happened to Neil, who's now questioning what just happened to him.

Neil quickly writes down the events leading up to it: A private investigator questioned him at a local shopping mall, since he believed Neil likely had a vital clue for his investigation, which is currently a cold case.  Whatever information the private investigator wanted, it's something that's apparently useful for the both of them.  The private investigator seemed to already know who Neil was.  The last thing Neil did, immediately before his.. "Blackout", he'll just call it that. was a passing thought he had, "What would my life been like had I-", Neil can't bring himself to write the rest.

Neil decides to put everything off until tomorrow, and goes to bed 2 hours early.
