The Paranormal Containment Agency (PCA) is a sandbox game based around constructing a facility meant to contain unexplainable and/or unnatural creatures referred to as _"parans"_.

You're tasked with containing and conducting research on Parans, using staff and/or death row inmates, the latter of which is at your complete disposal, while the former can conduct a greater amount of research, but can result in fines or temporary restrictions if they're harmed or killed.

Throughout the game, random events will occur, disrupting certain elements of your facility that could set Parans loose, and require specialized combative security to re-contain, whereas other events serve as the occasional general disruption.

There's no money system (for normal mode) with a reputation system in place for purchases that doesn't get used up, and you're able to equip up to 8 modifiers which don't need to be unlocked.
