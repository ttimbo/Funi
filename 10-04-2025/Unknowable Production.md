I wasn't all that motivated to work on KRUSHERS, so I decided to take a break today, and work on the story of Unknowable which has laid dormant for almost 14 months now (since June 29, 2024), but it's the most fleshed-out story in the trilogy, and still works well as a standalone story.

First, I'll reorganize the documents, and plan out the first 3 chapters.

Not sure where I was going with this draft.

Crosshairs P1 (6/1/2024)

  

  On May 1, 2000, a Monday, in an unspecified town, Gabriel is walking to school.


  While waiting at a crosswalk, a school bully, named Todd, starts teasing him, but is scared off by an unnamed, highschool sophomore passerby.
  

  During the last period of the school day, Gabriel and his class are making origami art, with their Art Teacher, Ms.Halsberg. Gabriel makes a goose out of red construction paper, draws the beak and wings with a black permanent marker, gives it small, green button eyes, then shows it off to Ms.Halsberg, who compliments him for his work.

  
  The bell rings soon after, and as Gabriel is packing up his bag, a fellow classmate introduces herself as Katelyn, and invites Gabriel to a slumber party at her house, which he gladly accepts.

 Back at home, Gabriel is watching Kids TV when his father, Lee, arrives home from work, sometime after 17:00. Since it’s now the Weekend, Lee promises to spend more time with Gabriel.
 
 The next day, Lee takes Gabriel to a nearby park

 Decided to continue working on Unknowable for the time being, perhaps the feeling of process of making a proper story is motivating me, especially when it's based on a unique idea that I haven't yet seen explored.
