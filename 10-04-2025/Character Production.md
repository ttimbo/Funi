Originally, Dr. Torrik merely lived long enough so that Dr. Helms could enter the workforce and gain his trust, so that Dr. Torrik relays his findings during the Krusher Project to Dr. Helms on his deathbed, leading Dr. Helms to revive the project, now with the focus of finding the secret of life.

Using the recovered body fluids from artificial organisms - which would become known as Krushers, specifically its Wall variant - created by The Subject during the original project, they were able to be reconstructed from mere lab mice _(though it had to be surrounded by raw materials to prevent it from using parts of the facility itself)_, and it was discovered using modern technology that they were capable of conscious thought, despite it being physically impossible with its unnatural biology, as well as its movement which it could only do by manipulating its body fluids, though inflicting Brain Death on the organism would return the laws of physics.

Dr. Torrik's death happened to line up close to Gavis's birth, so in the event that I continue the story pass the characters arrival to a refugee city outside the exclusion zone, I made it so that Torrik's spirit could've been reborn as Gavis by spacing those events apart by 9 months, which explains his willingness to fight against Krushers as subconscious guilt from his past life, but can still make sense as him being accustomed to Krushers after fighting against them 20 years prior.

Gabriel, being a further Holder of Reconstruction, could also subconsciously think of Gavis as an old friend, since Tally would help guide Gabriel when using his powers, and although Dr. Torrik could have a different spirit from Jeremy, because they have the same physical bodies, Gabriel could still have a vague sense of Jeremy from Dr. Torrik's spirit, since it would make it feel as if they're the same spirit as it's influenced by Tally's memories of Jeremy.

Changed the name of Trey's wife from Amelia to Alice.

Cut out an earlier draft of Cale's character description, which was almost entirely a repeat of it, other than a bit more detail about Gavis's influence on him.

Moved Martin to the Side Characters list, because I replaced his position in SST 6 with Milo who has a similar appearance but actually has plot significance afterwards, and I didn't have any reason to remove his character so I kept him in SST 3.

Made Cale the youngest member of SST 1, just barely old enough for the annual military training.

I gave Milo Devan an entry, made him the leader of SST 2 instead of Greg since he has experience with team coordination, and gave him a rattle snake tattoo that serves to mask the 20 tally marks on his torso for each life Milo took during the Millow Civil War, which he still feels guilty about even 25 years later.

Changed Cale's birthday to be in September since it makes more since for the military age requirement to be at 18, and would give Cale enough time to go through basic training, making him just barely one of the youngest soldiers in Division 40 before the Fall of Chinelo.

I tried changing Cale's and Milo's names, but "Leo" sounded less casual and young so I reverted it, and "Victor" felt too forced so I switched it to "_Marcus_" - I altered Kyle's new name from Davis to Dave since it would've been too similar to Gavis.

I also reverted Frank's name from "Andrew" because it sounded too forced.

The Subject, who was originally the KRUSHER's version of Tanalo but with a different Spirit, will instead be a different young Kuluho boy, otherwise it wouldn't make sense for Torrik's project to make use of an already matured Spiritual Holder.

Gave Don an actual unique last name instead of "Smith"

There was an old side character named Samuel in Sanctuary who was meant to make Rossgivian names pronounceable in English since Rossgivian has 3 extra vowels, but I'd hire VAs by that point so I removed his entry.
