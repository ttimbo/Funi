Rossgivo is a fictional European country similar in size and location to the Holy Roman Empire, which had existed for over a thousand years since 1065 (having started as a rebellious clan sometime during the Winter), and is one of the most internationally influential and militaristically powerful nations, with a long history of militaristic achievements and victories.

In January 1950, an event commonly known as the _Civilian Revolution_ had ousted Rossgivo's previous dictatorship's government and established a new democratic government on the 14th, which remains in power up to the story of KRUSHERS, ushering in a new era of peace as is symbolized in its flag.

In 1065, what would become Rossgivo "_emerged from the darkest and longest nights, out into sunlight as a ruthless, powerful kingdom_", according to recovered near-millennia old documents that collectively imply _sometime during the Winter from 1064 to 1065_, though the official date is _January 1, 1065_ because it's widely seen as the start of new beginnings within Rossgivo.

Compared to the Holy Roman Empire, Rossgivo has more continuous and linear borders, making Rossgivo _just over 1 million square kilometers in size_.

In Central Rossgivo lies the _Great Chasm_, 40km in length, formed over millions of years.


Rossgivo's architecture resembles that of the _Netherlands_, specifically its _dense urban cities_, and _pedestrianized-areas_, Netherlands-style canals are rare in cities though mostly because Rossgivo's far larger size makes it more noticeably limited to along coastlines and rivers _(albeit they're still uncommon.)_

Most of Rossgivo consists of _rural farmland_, with _hilly terrain_ in the central area - beneath which lies large valuable deposits of _coal, natural gas, thorium, and other minerals; Responsible for most of Rossgivo's mining industry._

  Cities dedicated to mining sprung up around the 1950s to 1980s, The largest being _**Toko**_, which became a ghost town after _Toko Central Mine_ - along with many others - was personally closed by the President of Rossgivo in 2018, in their bid to convert Rossgivo to Green Energy. _(Mines with minerals that could be refined into nuclear fuel were spared.)_

  Toko Central Mine was _Rossgivo's largest and most valuable coal mine_, with Toko peaking at a _population of 400,000_ in 1990, _but quickly plummeted after the mine's closure in 2018_, with its last few residents evicted in 2056. _However, much of Toko wasn't demolished_, as necessary resources to do so were instead put towards building trenches along frontlines to combat Krushers, and the ghost city's demolition was hardly a priority.

  Toko's architecture mirrors the style of Old Roblox _(outside of canon, of course)_ to convey its age and decay _(as in multi-coloured buildings, unconvincing windows, and lack of detail.)_ Having been largely abandoned for 50 years.
  
  Old but stable parts of Toko Central Mine were repurposed as part of a 2km underground tunnel in 2049, which bypassed much of the area's hilly terrain, continuing on the surface between the lower regions of the hills, providing direct access to a bridge spanning the Great Chasm. _(located just 12km south of Toko.)_

The Great Chasm bridge, officially named "_Tsunilph Bridge_", served as a major evacuation route in 2065 after the frontlines collapsed and Krushers began overrunning the country, _but was destroyed with explosives by the Rossgivo Military_ once the frontlines fell back to the chasm itself to prevent Krushers from crossing over. The _southern frontline_ held up until June 2066, when the Great Chasm was bypassed by Krushers, who breached the frontlines on the eastern end.
  While the Southern Frontline was active, a few Gears got trapped and killed in the Great Chasm, _despite being able to climb out, but couldn't due to the large military presence_.
  
  "Tsunilph" is pronounced Tsu-ni-lph. Purely to make it hard to pronounce, and has no in-world explanation for its name.

_The Rossgivo Sword_ is the highest military honour in Rossgivo. Its origins are unclear, but rumored to have started centuries prior _while Rossgivo was still a monarchy_, when an unknown Knight blew themselves up along with the enemy, in order to _protect their king_. It is said the _only thing left of the Knight was their **sword**_, which the King took, and later stuck into the honourary grave for the unknown Knight.
  This supposedly continued on over the centuries as a sign of great military honour, in the form of an actual Sword, _(but was replaced with a Sword Medal in 1953 to live up to the nation's newfound promise of peace)_, which is often used in war memorials to represent military sacrifice.  

Rossgivo's capital is **Nicole**, located 80km southwest of Chinelo, with a population of 4 million in December 2065, and was a major hub to Rossgivo's rail network.
  Nicole started as a village in the _Kingdom of Rossgivo_ during the early 1300s, but eventually grew into a large, bustling city. 
  
  After the fall of Chinelo, the frontlines fell back to just 25km north of Nicole.
  
  When the frontlines were breached in a coordinated attack in December 2065, 500k civilians died amidst the intense fighting against Krushers that took place in the city. 

The official language is [[Rossgivian]], with a writing system made up of simplified hieroglyph-like symbols that correspond to a specific sound associated with it _(ex. "**Ch**", a vertical line followed by an inward curve down, was simplified from a bird with closed wings, as in **the chirping of a bird**.)_

 A number of medieval and even ancient symbols which indicate meaning through appearance are still used, despite the aforementioned writing system replacing them in the early 1500s. Typically, it's for practicality reasons ("**Simple**" resembles a #, but with the right vertical line constrained between the two horizontal lines, as in it's _simple to write_.) Sometimes it's because of its history, such as with the _Rossgivo symbol_.
 
  "**Rossgivo**" can be spelt phonetically, and as symbol, the latter being more popular as its used in the nation's "_founding document_" (1064-1065, _but it's merely the oldest known reference of Rossgivo, with no indication of it being official in any way_, though it's a common misconception.)

  However, the symbol's true meaning was lost to time, and the name "Rossgivo" derived from an 1562 phonetic translation, but _how_ it was translated was too lost to time. All of this led to widespread rumors about the true meaning of the _Rossgivo symbol_, with people trying to figure out what the symbol was a depiction of.

 Symbols are written to indicate their meaning through their appearance, and meant to be unique, with any similarities either being coincidental, or the meanings between symbols having similar characteristics themselves.






At the start of 2065, the population of Rossgivo was 300 million - Throughout the catastrophe of Krushers overrunning Rossgivo, 3 million were killed, 260 million refugees fled into neighbouring countries, and _2 million were left stranded inside the GCO Exclusion Zone_.

  Because of the massive number of refugees, _on top of needing to hold off Krushers_, would greatly strain countries directly neighbouring Rossgivo: "France", "The Balkans", and Millow.
  
  The logistical nightmare went well above any emergency response plan, with some government officials even comparing the international calamity to the aftermath of Nuclear Armageddon.

  Many refugees would travel further into what, in our world, would be _UK, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe_ (past Millow), and _Northern Africa_; Some even went overseas to Roxia. In response to this, the government of Roxia stepped in, providing large financial and military support to the struggling nations, and would work alongside the remnants of the Rossgivo government to fight against Krushers from then on. _(from late 2066)_
  
  Because _Rossgivo was the most technologically advanced country_ at the time, the refugees brought with them a wealth of knowledge and expertise, which led to exponential growth in economies, population _(though mostly from refugees themselves)_, and quality of life.
  
  _Millow, once an impoverished nation, only known for its brutal and bloody history of civil war_, quickly became a fast-growing and developing nation, as the mountain range along its border with Rossgivo provided extensive protection from Krushers.

  Even in _Northern Africa_, large bustling cities were created along the coastlines just from refugees, _who oftentimes well surpassed original populations_. Because of the stark contrast between Rossgivo and _Northern Africa_ in demographics, and culture, differences between refugees and original populations were abundantly clear, _with some of the original populations being completely unaware of the existence of many technologies brought over by the Rossgivian refugees_.

35 million civilians either already lived south of the _southern mountain range_, or on _Nicholas Island_, and because Krushers were stopped at the southern mountain range, these civilians could stay in place, which provided a faint sense of _"the old Rossgivo"_ for many rescued survivors.
  
  There's constant surveillance by armed Fighter Jets scouting out for any Gears attempting to cross over the mountain range, and would be able to neutralize them, which is the most effective means to stop Gears given the _1200 km long mountain range_.

Krushers first appeared at a campsite near the Eastern Mountain Range, in the early hours of _January 14, 2050 - the 100 year anniversary of the 1950 Rossgivo Revolution_. Their existence was then leaked, and the Government of Rossgivo made an official statement concerning Krushers on _January 30_, confirming their existence.
  
  Jeremy Torrik had created the first Krushers from lab rats, during his experiments to figure out the spiritual powers of the Kuluho, leading him to discover that the key to unlocking spiritual powers was from BRK-D8 - _Normally a deadly poison created from plant serum native to Brazil, which would quickly lead to Brain Death after being injected into a person's bloodstream, was dependent on one's DNA purity, and it would grant them spiritual powers if there's been enough previous generations where foreign DNA hadn't been introduced._
  
  Foreign DNA introduced afterwards wouldn't override their immunity, however they won't gain full control of their powers, nor be informed of them, but they could still receive spiritual powers as long as the mother had sufficient pure DNA.
  
  If it was instead only from the father, they may still have immunity, but won't gain any spiritual powers.



Because Krushers couldn't cross the eastern mountain range, it raised questions about why they first appeared within the lower regions of the eastern mountain range, which although wasn't impossible for them to reach, showed no signs of them doing so.

Krushers can freely manipulate their body fluids through unexplained, physics-defying means; can reconstruct damaged sections of their body an unlimited amount of times; are always able to exert massive amounts energy despite seemingly being unable to resupply it; have an unnatural biology, with hollow bodies, a large volume of body fluids that normally pools at the bottom which Krushers use to protect its outer skin, or for movement, which itself is usually made of commonly used construction materials; and have no explanation for how they were created, or why they suddenly appeared in Rossgivo.




**Alcrassia** - Takes the place of France.

**Purcu** - South of Millow, mostly taking the place of the Balkans (just its territory) otherwise Millow would've been too awkwardly large.

**Roxia** - The 2nd most powerful nation that takes USA's place, with its language, Roxian, really just being English. After the fall of Rossgivo, Roxia provided a massive amount of aid to neighbouring nations that were struggling with the huge influx of Rossgivian refugees, and contained Krushers to inside the ruins of Rossgivo, using its abundance of anti-Krusher weaponry, and large airforce.

**Millow** - An impoverished nation with a long, brutal, and bloody history of civil war, but had been at peace since 2045. Despite having a far inferior military, the mountain range along it's border with Rossgivo _protected Millow from Krushers_, as their _body shapes_ and _movement_ prevent them from climbing the steep slopes, which, although isn't a problem for Gears, had only occurred three times _(The Gear that raided Sanctuary doesn't count)_ with constant surveillance by the Roxian Airforce easily subduing any such threats.

**Maltova** - Northern Africa, like people with hoods riding camels, and desert towns (no specifics), which basically turns into _Dubai but it's humane_ following the large influx of Rossgivo refugees that brought over their knowledge and technology, with some being so advanced that much of the original populations never knew about them beforehand.

When Rossgivo refugees started coming over into Maltova, their greater expertise and skill limited job opportunities for much of its original population, so much so that a large group of young Maltovian orphans banded together to steal _solely_ from the refugees just so they could survive.

Tensions grow when one of these orphans was shot and killed by a survivor rescued from the Exclusion Zone as the orphan was trying to convince the survivor out of suicide, only to be killed for being a thief. The fact the killer was a survivor rather than a refugee is what flared up tensions.
