  _Opening scenes were revised to be more in-line with the series_
  
  _SCENE: GAVIS & SST 6_
   _It's Ken and Fredrick's first time leaving Stronghold Fox in 5 years_.
  
   Gavis is the oldest by a wide margin at 50 years old, 13 years older than Greg, the co-Leader, and 27 years older than Fredrick, the youngest member of SST 6. _Yet despite Gavis' old age, he's the squad leader of SST 6_, partly because he grew up in Chinelo and is well familiarized with the general area, _but mostly because Gavis fought in the military against Krushers when they first appeared 20 years prior_, and had killed 5 Krushers _(as a Tank Gunner.)_


   SST 6 drives through abandoned Netherlands-style streets on 4 motorcycles - 3 people riding on backseats. There's crushed cars piled onto sidewalks, having been pushed out of the way by Krushers, all while the faint whirring of drones can be heard overhead.
   
   Gavis, the only one without a passenger, takes out his radio after hearing indistinct radio chatter, before suddenly making a sharp turn at an intersection he was about to drive straight through. For the other motorcycle drivers: Greg and Martin quickly decelerate to make the turn, Fredrick has to slam on the brakes just to avoid driving past.    
   
   SST 6 drives up to a Roxian Embassy, stopping one by one after Gavis does so. After taking off their motorcycle helmets, Greg questions Gavis on why they deviated from the planned route.
   
   _**Greg**_
   Gavis, why did we stop here? This place wasn't on the route.
   
   _**Gavis**_
   There's Krushers right down that street. C'mon, _(points head towards the wide open Embassy entrance)_ we gotta get out of the open. Then we'll think of a different route.
   
   Fredrick, bring your motorcycle inside with you- _(a loud nearby crashing noise cuts him off)_ ..Right now _(starts talking on radio, while gesturing the others to continue inside)_ Hey, Drone-Guy, those Krushers you just mentioned, did they send a bird straight to the shadow realm or what? _(inaudible response)_ They didn't move? _(in a more serious tone)_
   
   _Gavis quickly moves inside the Embassy, glancing at the two Roxian flags adjacent to the entrance that are down in the wind, before responding with the general direction of the noise's source; West._

  _SCENE: ROXIAN EMBASSY_
   
   _Following along with Gavis' POV_, there's two motorcycles parked behind the reception desk, but Fredrick is off to the side with his motorcycle, positioned on a ray of sunlight shining though the front windows, frantically searching though storage compartments strapped onto the sides, all while John hassles him about a map.
   
   _Gavis relays that they're currently at the Roxian Embassy over the radio, continued from the previous scene, before putting his radio back in his waist belt._
   
   _**John**_
   ..We're gonna need that map, Rookie.
   
   _**Fredrick**_
   _(shuffles through compartments on the sides of his motorcycle)_ I swear I brought it... Ah! _(pulls out a folded-up map)_ here it is! _(passes it over to Gavis, who he just noticed came inside)_
   
   _**Gavis**_
   John, go easy on the kid, you're a decade older than him- _(unfolds map, immediate look of disappointment)_ This is... a nation-wide map. _(flips the map around to show the others - It's a map of the nation Rossgivo, as in only city locations are labeled. As for why Fredrick had it: There's Krusher-infested areas marked off in black marker by other SSTs from previous expeditions, with the last known GCO Exclusion Zone marked off in red.)_
   
   _**Ken**_
   _(looks at Fredrick)_ ..How did you even mess that up? Does that look like Chinelo to you?
   
   _Gavis listens to the radio response from the Drone operators, while Ken tussles with Fredrick in the background._
   
   _**Gavis**_
   What?
   
   _**Drone-Guy**_
   There was a third Krusher, 3 blocks of west from your current position. The other 2 Krushers are still in the Plaza.
   
   Not seeing any other Krushers, or signs of activity, however we haven't conducted a wide search.
   
   _**Gavis**_
   Yeah.. We also didn't bring a city map.. _(glances back)_
   
   _Fredrick (distant)_
   ..Wasn't it tacked to a wall? What, you took it down and didn't notice anything off about it?
   
   _Doe (distant)_
   It was taken down the other day because of a water leak, not sure why Fredrick thought it'd be useful.
   
   _**Drone-Guy**_
   Continuing on without a map is too risky. If you're going to backtrack back to the Stronghold, you'd have to pass by rather close to that third Krusher. Perhaps we can guide you past it?
   
   _**Gavis**_
   ... Maybe there's a map in Embassy..
   
   _**Fredrick**_
   _(overheard Gavis)_ Yeah! Let's check the Embassy for a map!
   
   _**Gavis**_
   I wasn't- _(decides to go along with it - puts his radio away)_ Can any of you read Roxian? Because that'll make my life easier.
   
   _Fredrick:_ Not at all.
   _Ken:_ I only know how to tell Roxians that I don't speak Roxian. Can't read Roxian, obviously.
   
   _Greg:_ No, but Gavis, can't you read Roxian?
   
   _**Gavis**_
   Somewhat. I picked up from Trey, but there was hardly any reason to try learning it _now_.
   
   Anyways, start looking around a map, there'll probably be one of those evacuation maps in a drawer or something.
   
   _**Fredrick**_
   Wait.. _(follows Gavis as the others split up)_ Trey can speak Roxian?
   
   _**Gavis**_
   _(sarcastic)_ Oh, I'm not actually sure.. I better ask him next time- Yeah, he's from Roxia, of course he can. But it's not like he's here with us, so where exactly is this going?
   
   _Fredrick:_ I just wanted to ask, that's all.
   _Gavis:_ This isn't some field trip, we're out in the territory of the Krushers on a mission, and ignoring your Squad Leader isn't a good foot to start off on..

Start of SST HQ scene was altered to remove distractions caused by a water leak, and to introduce Martin later on in a more fitting and realistic way.

Simplified Ruiz's explanation of Krusher damage, because Cale already knows what it is.

Removed Ruiz's mention SST 1's objective in the calendar scene, and revised its ending.
  Cale mentions SST 1's objective in a subtle way, along with his question about the lack of military involvement without focusing too much on it.
  
  _Cale's question about the lack of military involvement or attempted use for the past 5 years_
   **_Cale_**
   "..Actually, I have one more question. Not to get out of work or anything, I've meant to ask this for a while now... _Why hasn't the military rescued us, or at least contact us for the past 5 years?_"
   
   _Ruiz remains still with his back turned to Cale, completely silent, but the act of it acknowledges Cale's question._
   
   "..It's something I've been wondering about, I know you can't answer with certainty, but even if the conflict against Krushers has dragged on for most of our lives, you'd think they'd just use helicopters to bypass them?"
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   _Faint mumbling_ "I.. I'm not sure.."
   
   **_Cale_**
   "I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.." _Cale notices Ruiz's lack of a response, and replies more bluntly_ "What did you say?"
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   "I just haven't been able to come up with a logical explanation. Most traditional weaponry is practically useless against Krushers, and when we got caught up in this whole mess, we barely had any sort of specialised weaponry against them.
   
   But even if that's still the case, like you said, they're most certainly able to bypass the Krushers by using helicopters. Of course, a rescue operation of the entire stronghold using only helicopters would most definitely be difficult, and yet, they haven't even tried contacting us..."
   
   **_Ruiz (2)_**
   "I know we've been trying to reach the new frontlines, wherever they are, for the past couple of months now, but the military's lack of intervention ever since we got stranded in the stronghold, is something I've never been able to explain or rationalize."
  
  _Old Ending:_
  
  There was a lack of _anti-Krusher weaponry_ back in 2065, which saw limited use as it was only effective if shot into a Krusher's eye. _Chinelo_ was a major logistical hub for the frontlines, so the loss of the city massively hindered the defense of the (still-standing) frontlines.
   
   Ruiz doesn't understand why the military hasn't contacted the Stronghold, or at least used helicopters to get past the Krushers, or even _how_ the Krushers managed to breach the frontlines. He jokingly says that they'll be the ones reaching the military, since he can't imagine the military being overwhelmed by Krushers, mentioning that Krushers can be easily stopped by trenches.
   
   Ruiz corrects his previous statement just as he's leaving the staffroom, and that "can" should've been "could", implying trenches were bypassed by Krushers at one point, but Ruiz doesn't know how it happened.
   
   _**Ruiz**_
   Even if we screwed up in Chinelo, I doubt the military would falter across Krushers if they can be thwarted by metre-deep trenches.
   
   _(starts walking back to the front of the store, but stops in the doorway of the staffroom)_ ..Actually, "could be" is more accurate. Not sure how they got past them though.

Cut out comment on Ruiz's love interest because it felt childish.
  _One of the other SST 1 members in the front of the store, Kyle, comments on Ruiz's long presence in the staffroom, and teases him about Ruiz's "the love of his life", to which Ruiz makes a snappy comeback about a similar supposed love interest Kyle used to have before the fall of Chinelo._
   
   **_Kyle_**
   "You took quite a while in the back, Ruiz.
   
   Was it important, or were you telling Cale about the love of your life? He's a new recruit after all."
   
   **_Cale_**
   _(overhears it just as he's leaving the staffroom behind Ruiz)_ "..Wait what?"
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   "Why do you make it seem like.." (a younger girl at SST HQ spread it around, but I chose to scrap it right here due to how childish it sounded, and the silent hint of it in episode 3 just felt better)

Altered the store's layout slightly so the storage room is accessible from the backdoor, and to also cut out Ruiz's pondering on where it is - I also made it more obvious that Cale didn't expect a skylight in the staffroom _(which is just there for better lighting during the calendar scene)_

Changed Cale and Ruiz's conversation to be more natural and also mention the stronghold, a bit of worldbuilding, as well as a bit of Gavis's character, instead of Cale randomly bringing (some of) them up.


Changed the outdoor area in the Rossgivo Flag scene from a square to a park, and explained how a Krusher accessed it without impacting Gavis's joke too much, but I mostly added more details that made the scene less vague (Gavis's joke also foreshadows Krushers having higher intelligence, which meant Slammers and Gears because Walls were never included at any yet)

Reused a comment in the original draft of the Rossgivo Flag scene that showed a generational difference in education norms between Gavis and Kinn, and changed the symbolism and design of the Rossgivo Flag from 4 triangles all together since it felt a bit overwhelming, and the red representing "bloodshed", and that the effects of it still lingering on.. was just too aggressive (that last part wouldn't've made much sense story-wise anyway, since the flag comes into use in 1950.)

Added more detail to the Rossgivo Flag scene about the park's damage, revised the descriptions about the drones to help explain the difference between them and the one used for surveying while planning SST 6's expedition (a while earlier in the episode, but there's no draft for it yet as of 4/16/2025, 20:07)

The city name of Thurein, which we see in the opening scenes, was taken from "the city they're in" as the city was initially left unnamed, just so it can be referred to directly if needed.

Moved some of Ruiz's dialogue to before the Calendar scene so it feels a bit more natural.

Changed the fall of Chinelo from January 4th to the 2nd, which sounds like a major change, but nothing else in the story conflicts with it, it still hurts Rossgivo's pride since it's right after the nation's 1000 year anniversary, but because the January 2, 2065, is a Thursday, some of the earliest worldbuilding we first get from Ruiz and Cale's conversation makes it obvious that nobody came into work the next day, instead of looking like an error, or making the calendars strangely offset for ours.

Removed SST armband because it only served as a indicator for organization, and that SST 1 wasn't a wandering group of survivors, a point that's easily made clear in the dialogue anyway.

Described more of the store in the opening scenes to better give off the small normalcy feeling, though adding the dust will certainly be difficult, and there's no way I'm animating it _(outside of Blender simulations for Part 2 in 2026)_

Removed part where SST 1 throws things they can't take or don't need onto the floor in piles, because it just creates a tripping hazard, and didn't make any sense when I actually thought about how it would play out when animated.

Made Cale use a flashlight instead of the lantern when looking for the storage room because it made more sense that the lantern assists the rest of SST 1 instead, so I added Cale passing the lantern over to Ruiz, who presumably passes it someone else when Cale calls him over shortly after.

Reorganized the entrance of the store and the specific details about it into its own scene because its description became rather long, so I made it compactable and provided summaries of it.

Simplified the summary for the Calendar scene which originally had a bunch of specific details, and added more details about what led up to it.

Removed detail about the drone used to survey Perksons Power Plant barely having enough battery life to last just a single roundtrip between it and the stronghold, since the 3 drones that accompany SST 6 on their expedition have larger battery lives, and using one of the scout drones for surveying makes more sense instead of the HQ doing an absolutely reckless survey considering the nuclear power plant is the stronghold's _only sustainable power source_.

Made the explanations for some of Ruiz's reactions in the Calendar scene more clear.

Made Ruiz's reasoning for nobody having the chance to come into work on January 2th, 2065 (the store in the Calendar scene), feel more natural by changing the focus from the presence of upcoming vacation days already having been marked down, to several employees who marked down their shifts where they'd all be working at the store on the 2nd (I also reduced the number of shifts marked down from 6 to 3 so it's obvious only some of the employee had the chance to mark theirs down, since they would've gotten the chance to do so for a single day before the following evacuation)

Reduced Chinelo's size to 6km in width (including outskirts), and its population down to 100,000 (150,000 pre-2062), after realising the Netherlands barely even has cities close to Chinelo's original population of about a million, and although Perksons Power Plant would be in a rural area which should logically cut down on SST's 6 expected expedition length by a couple hours (as well as for SST 1's expedition a couple days prior), it honestly doesn't really change much.

Redrafted the Encounter scene and made it simpler to understand, and added the mentions of Ruiz's smoke grenade when his appearance is first described in the Store scene (which I renamed from "A Strangely Normal Store" so that it's easier to mention)

Changed the design of the Trac-a-nator to make more sense because the bottom centre eye of a Krusher is the quickest and simplest route to its brain, since it's anti-Krusher weapon was originally beside its left forward wheel.

Changed the Hotel scene to be set in an apartment building instead.

Changed the stronghold's distance from Perksons Power Plant to 8km, and its distance to the city of Thurein to 20km, just so the distance travelled by the SSTs feels more careful and thought out.

Removed random detail of Cale formerly being an Inspector for airport security because it made more sense for Ruiz to stay with the rest of SST 1, which also would've served no importance past the opening scenes.

Added wall art detail of Rossgivo right at the beginning to give us a general idea of the story's location to first-time viewers, provide a sense of a long passage of time with its faded paint, and also build up the "1000 year anniversary" the nation of Rossgivo had just before its society fell, which is a minor detail for the following opening scenes.

Simplified the beginning of episode 1's document by grouping up the specific information of Ruiz's Arm Blades into a "Shot", because it was rather long and wasn't part of the Store scene, but calling the mere showcase of the Arm Blades a "Scene" just didn't make sense.

Note for self: The use of unique objects or details to indicate the same location from different camera angles was inspired by the beginning of another Roblox Animation, where a TV billboard uses a bright pattern to indicate a sniper's location and target.

While redoing the opening to avoid going into the Calendar scene before the premise is clear, I thought of a festival celebrating Rossgivo's 1000 year anniversary before the city of Thurein fell, but scrapped the idea since it would've went on for too long.

Changed the opening scene to SST 1's arrival at Thurein to show more of their experience, and also start off on things such as the nation of Rossgivo, their attempt at reaching the frontlines which they failed to do numerous times before, the fact slopes can slow down Krushers, which have kept them inside Rossgivo despite them first appearing very to near the eastern border since it follows a tall mountain range, that Thurein was evacuated before any Krushers reached it, and the fact SST 1 isn't a stray group of survivors but an organized group that left from Stronghold Fox. All of which are important details would've been brought up later on.

Also, it largely scraps the need for the Calendar scene, but the beginning of it is kept and put into the Store scene.

Removed detail of wrecked tanks and military vehicles in Thurein to better match the narrative of the city having been evacuated prior to the arrival of Krushers.

Cleaned up some descriptions in the opening scene, and removed the detail Thurein being located in an area dried out by an old Hydro Dam upstream of the city's river because I felt there wasn't a need to explain Thurein's geography.

Replaced a vague comment from Cale about the lack of wind making Krusher movements more predictable with Ruiz pointing out a still-standing flag pole that typically always taken out by Krushers, which felt more realistic rather than a random comment about the lack of wind being a good thing despite hardly affecting anything (which itself has nothing to do with the flag pole that's still standing, it's just that single Krusher in Thurein was the first Krusher to arrive in the city merely a couple days prior to SST 1, but had barely caused any damage.)

Removed wind turbines near Thurein because logically they're too conspicuous to not be collapsed by a Krusher within 5 years (it would've also raised questions, since much of the episode is focused on Perksons Power Plant, which is Stronghold Fox's only sustainable source of power.)

Made the detail of steep inclines slowing down Krushers but not ramps more clear.

Removed the detail of scattered buildings between the hills being part of Thurein, since they'd be included too briefly to justify detailing them, and served no purpose in the story.

Described Cale at the beginning, and gave him a basic appearance.

Removed overhanging ridges on the cliffs along Thurein's river because a river logically shouldn't have craved them out, and it didn't really serve any purpose.

Explained SST 1's task of reaching the frontlines, Thurein being evacuated before Krushers ever reached it and still going completely untouched by them, gave the idea of SST 1 being an experienced scouting team as there's been _at least_ 9 previous expeditions searching for the new frontlines which has already cleared out a large amount of area around what's presumably "Stronghold Fox" located in Chinelo, and put a mention of Rossgivo historically being the world's most militaristically powerful nation.

Removed section of Nathan being frustrated at having to spend a night outside the Stronghold with the threat of Krushers, which didn't make sense since it'd be expected, and the detail of most of the stranded soldiers of Division 40 being too cowardly to leave the stronghold can be brought up later, and I found a comedic bit between Cale and Nathan that brought up Gavis and the stark contrast between him and Ruiz.

Removed Ruiz's sarcastic comment about Krushers potentially flying off the highway exit into Thurein when he's explaining to Cale about why they shouldn't go down it, which I felt didn't make sense for Ruiz to mention as a highly experienced SST leader.

Changed the reason for the tall cliffs near Thurein to be the result of an asteroid impact, which also created the flat terrain where Thurein is located, because I felt like an ancient lake wouldn't really carve out the terrain to such an extent. It also sounds cooler.

Fixed a horrendous scientific inaccuracy where the asteroid that created the crater Thurein was built in, had been as wide as the crater itself, which changed from 800m (Thurein is a little over a kilometre in size now, along with the crater) to 50m. And I reduced the timespan from 200,000 years to 30,000 years prior, since those smaller impacts are much more common though I needed the crater to become part of the environment in a reasonable amount of time. Later I intentionally made the crater depth very shallow at just 30m, in order to fit the image of Thurein I had without making the city feel too much like it's in a deep pit.

Minor changes to the description of the opening scene to better reflect itself, and separated the "An Unnerving Feeling" scene from Episode 1, so it can be used elsewhere at some point.

After building part of the intersection for the "Highway" scene _(and putting together a better generic car model as a reference)_, I made the Krusher barriers a bit slimmer, and added a tall front made of metal so that it'd cover more surface area, and also look durable - I then realised they're all supposed to be torn apart, but they can be used as a cool source of cover during Episode 11.

This isn't covered in Episode 1, but I chose to changed the role of the New Frontlines (the ones that followed the Fall of Chinelo) over to the Southern Frontlines (along the Great Chasm - now I realised that name wouldn't make sense because the Great Chasm is in the north half of Rossgivo) Instead, the frontlines that followed the Fall of Chinelo will be breached near the end of January, and their construction will reflect that by being more lackluster, and the military gets caught up in stopping the influx of Krushers for them to contact Stronghold Fox - which itself is established to not meet the standards of Krusher Strongholds because how much their perceived threat had dwindled in the past 12 years, so Stronghold Fox won't have any satellite-based communications installed, and any satellite phones some people bring in would soon lose most of their coverage, as most of the communication satellites are from Rossgivo, and most of their ground stations based in Rossgivo would get overrun a year later.

Narrowed down Thurein's highway exit from 4 lanes to 2 lanes because it felt strange for a town of about 3000 people - though I increased the population to 10,000 (then decreased it back down to 3,000 because the town felt too big when I started making the rough outline of the set.)

Removed early mention in the Highway scene of the military not contacting the stronghold in the past 5 years, because its placement felt far too early and didn't really make sense - I also changed the road signs from overhanging signs to medium sized signs off to the sides of the highways, and I chose to make Thurein's highway exit one-way only, otherwise it would feel way too small - but I changed the road signs back to overhanging signs since I realised while remembering to add a city SST 1 originally planned to stay the 1st night in, that the distance to Nicole was too vast for there not to be other towns and cities marked, and the extra debris can help mask the barren highways.

I decided to make Thurein's elevation difference more gradual, and the city's existence more understandable by having the asteroid graze down the terrain instead, rather than creating a crater that people decided to live in for whatever reason.

Made Ruiz's mention of Krusher Barriers a bit more casual by making it a reaction when he realises one of the barriers managed to survive for the past 5 years - I also removed the mention of Ruiz narrowing escaping death by switching off of frontline duty the day before everyone stationed on the lines near Chinelo were killed, but implied a similar fate without focusing on it - ended up just making Ruiz not bring them up since they were already torn apart and weren't installed anywhere else as far as he knew, because it realistically wouldn't make sense for him not to spot it at all.

I made up the city name "_Octaluo_" on the spot - not important but I wanted to mention that detail.

Removed an oddly specific detail in the Frederick scene which was already easily inferable.

Changed the explanation of the Krusher Barriers to be more realistic by having them take advantage of a Krusher's behaviour rather than normally being physically impossible to break, and it also brings up structural damage typically being collateral damage when Krushers chase a target at an earlier point when it's a relevant detail - edited it bit afterwards so it was more clear.

Cleaned up some strange wording about a mention of the Fall of Chinelo in the Highway scene, though I'll probably cut it later down the line - ended up generalizing it to the collapse of the frontlines because of how strange it felt for them to call it the Fall of Chinelo, and removed a section of dialogue that directly mentioned it because it felt too strange and exposition-like, and wasn't even relevant for the rest of the episode.

Shortened Ruiz's explanation of the Krusher Barriers so the Highway scene can move by quicker.

I realised episode 1 focused on the SSTs but hardly on the actual stronghold, so I lengthened the episode to 30 minutes to focus a bit more on the stronghold and how its residents have adapted to living inside one, as well as to serve as a bit of downtime between intense scenes.

This comes at the expense of condensing "Road to Sanctuary" into "Survival 301" and removing the Slammer fight that was supposed to be its ending due to time constraints, though the Great Chasm is moved back to its original position in the south to serve as an obstacle in Episode 16, while the hilly terrain can still be used as part of the 'new frontlines'.

Changed the cliffs surrounding Thurein to just be on the northern edge as a natural formation, since its small population of 3,000 realistically means it has short buildings - removed Thurein's clocktower because of this detail.

Removed the detail of the drone not being usable since I wasn't sure how to explain it, so I changed it so that the Krusher and its structural damage weren't spotted by Kyle (drone operator)

Simplified how Ruiz's Arm Blades work by reducing it down to tension created on the blades when the excess length of rope is pulled out by the handle, which can be shown during the Arm Blades shot since it isn't hidden inside the leather base anymore.

For the opening scenes with SST 1, we learn vague details about Krushers since they refer to their behaviour which SST 1 is already familiar with, though this is _mostly just to avoid feeling like forced exposition right off the bat for Episode 1_, because it always felt off to me even if it provided important information - I moved this over to the changelog and added context for it, since this detail is just an opinion of mine, so I shortened it down to the actual narrative.

Made it clear that the story begins 20 years after the first appearance of Krushers, starting off with Ruiz as a small innocent child who's father was killed in action while fighting against the first Krushers, showed that the existence of Krushers gradually became accepted over the years, and how ill-equipped Stronghold Fox actually is by revealing that its location was merely one out of convenience rather than carefully chosen which was told to us only a minute prior, and showing how the local area was barely even changed compared to the other strongholds.

To make the tale of the Rossgivo Sword feel more widespread, Ruiz watches a children's show _(originally just to show how much time had passed since Krushers first appeared)_ which Louis's attention is drawn towards and figures out that it's based off an old children's book with the same title that Louis read as a kid, then Louis realises that one of the scenes was altered to make it similar to the famous tale of the Rossgivo Sword, leading to Louis going over the tale just to explain how similar they actually are.

Changed the John scene - will probably combine it with the Reactor Shutdown scene later on - so that John doesn't take the night-watch of the stronghold's generators seriously, by showing him having already fallen asleep rather than him just being bored.

Original: _John is_ sitting on a chair off to the side reading a long novel to pass the time, as the ticking of a clock can be heard nearby.

I also made the difference of power generation from the generators compared to the power consumption to be far more noticeable, since it made more sense for John to mention that the alarm normally should've already gone off, and that he had to reverse a bit of its circuitry so it wouldn't constantly go off without removing it which somehow breaks the entire dashboard, but the fact the gauge has nothing to do with triggering the alarm leads John to realise that there was a problem with Perksons Power Plant.

Simplified the description of Ruiz's Arm Blades.

Ditched the sci-fi element in the children's show Ruiz watches as a child, since it made it confusing of what the show was about - somehow, I chose "Hokori" to be a Japanese-sounding name for the Red One, but it was an actual Japanese name, and its meaning fit well with the character _(I didn't even plan this beforehand.)_

Simplified the opening scenes by removing long descriptions about Ruiz that I already memorized.

Decided to go with the An Unnerving Feeling scene for the start of the episode, so that it begins at Stronghold Fox, sets up the Slammer reveal as well as Trey and Gabriel's abilities, and leads into the John scene where it's revealed that the Stronghold's construction was lackluster and that it had to rely on a nearby nuclear power plant for a stable supply of power, for the past several years that they've been isolated from the outside world, but ends up automatically shutting down its last online reactor unit, creating the main objective for the episode.

Removed the detail of Trey pretending the apartment windows looked into the past by putting up sci-fi decorations around them in an attempt to preserve Gabriel's innocence by keeping him from questioning what was outside the stronghold, which I felt would just raise more questions from Gabriel, and I had already decided that Gabriel would at least know there were monsters outside the stronghold, just not any specific details.

Hinted at Gabriel sensing a Krusher when he tells his dad Trey that he feels something (a Slammer) staring back at him out in the distance, which he wouldn't actually see from such a distance, but Gabriel can't properly explain due to his young age.

Removed the tall pillars that would've been behind the trench at the Stronghold's entrance, since it had to have been built after the Fall of Chinelo, which didn't make sense at all since they were 5m tall, and the Slammer breaks through the perimeter wall instead so I removed them (Originally, the Slammer would've broken the pillars from the top-down, causing them to crumble as they weren't designed to handle that sort of stress.)

Removed what was the John scene after the alarm goes off, which although isn't normally a result of the reactor shutdown since it's meant to be on an isolated grid, it basically is, so I removed the note below the gauge that would've explained it to make sure that the idea gets across, since I felt that having John explain it right there wouldn't be all that important.

Reorganized and began work on the 13k wordcount drafts for the Thurein scenes, which goes up until the Power Shortage scene.

Much of it is details for scenes that I've already cut or revised that I simply hadn't gotten to yet, so here's to hoping I can get it under 8k words, or at least into a readable state by the end of the day!

_8/08/2025 13:30_
I'm writing at a snails pace now, I'm taking a break.

_8/08/2025 16:40_
Reorganized a bit of the drafts, cutting out old notes and comments.

_8/10/2025 10:53_
Removed copyright detail on the nation-wide map in the navigation room, which was meant to indicate that the Stronghold's residents have been there for 5 years, but it realistically would've been very hard to notice unless it was shown in a closeup - ended up reverting this 4 days later.

_13:44_
Changed the scattered debris of the Krusher Barriers to better match what would've happen when Krushers began moving down that highway, though there'll still be small chunks of debris left in odd areas to hint at a Gear having destroyed them.

_16:24_
I'm thinking of changing Ruiz's reason for being cautious when entering Thurein to him ensuring the safety of the rest of his squad, rather than him just trying to stick to his own protocols.

It would make sense for Cale to think that there's no Krushers in Thurein, since he himself helped assist in the evacuations and would be aware that it was evacuated well before Krushers could reach it, and unlike the other evacuated towns and cities, it would be difficult for any Krushers to go down into Thurein since it wouldn't lead them anywhere.

I decided to make Cale's lack of concern as being similar to what got Ruiz's mortar squad killed during the Fall of Chinelo, when they attempted to destroy a bridge leading into Chinelo from the north while in an exposed position, believing that they're well ahead of the Krushers, only for Ruiz to narrowly avoid being killed by one by chance.

_8/11/2025 12:39_
Changed the Exclusion Zone on the map of Rossgivo to use light grey shading for the 8km region from the frontlines to indicate that they have lighter restrictions.

_8/12/2025 14:47_
This doesn't add anything, but during the Highway scene, Ruiz noticed the undamaged structure on the northbound. He still initially ignores it though.

_8/14/2025 8:50_
Decided to explain the solar panels on the roof of the SST HQ, originally just meant to draw attention towards the building, as a lackluster secondary alternative for power that Strongholds were required to have.

_15:34_
I made the explanation of Krusher Barriers (and the street barricades in Chinelo which relates to it) get brought up by Cale, because the highway is a common route and so the rest of SST 1 wouldn't have any reason to question it if they had the chance to during previous expeditions, and made Ruiz go through the explanation rather quickly as if he's already done that several times already.

_15:48_
I removed the detail of the Krushers previously overflowing on the highway, and the detour SST 1 would've had to take because I feel that a low volume of Krushers alone would better explain their decision to stay the night in Thurein, since explaining it as Don moving the Krushers in preparation for the attack on Stronghold Fox didn't make sense since he wouldn't have a reason to do that yet.

Also, the detail didn't build up to anything.

_8/15/2025 11:28_
This detail is merely in the background, but I decided to have the parent company that originally owned the office building SST HQ is located in to be part of "_Greyson Industries_", because its CEO Neil Greyson was concerned about the nearby frontlines as a result of his Messenger Power which he didn't know of at the time, though it'll probably 10 years when I decide on whether to continue the story of KRUSHERS and add onto that detail.

_16:00_
Changed the opening scenes to start with the discovery of what's most likely the _New Frontlines_ by SST 1 during their 18th expedition, but were forced to return to Stronghold Fox when Everett, one of the last three remaining original members of SST 1, was killed by Krusher which severed his body in half when Everett attempted to flee back to a nearby alleyway as a sudden gust of wind had agitated the Krusher towards his position.

This led to Ruiz waiting for a day with very low wind before setting out on the 19th expedition. 

_8/17/2025 10:08_
This is just a note to self, but Millow and Rossgivo were first just team names for a team based military combat game I briefly worked on back in 2023, with Millow being rebels and would have more patchwork-style uniforms and clothing, a concept I reused for the Millow Civil War except its now foreign merceries who work for the rebels to help overthrow the corrupt government so it isn't an actual war, and Rossgivo was originally Roskiv which I decided to reuse as the Roxian translation of Rossgivo.

_8/19/2025 11:15_
Decided to explain the low number of Krushers during the 19th expedition as Don moving nearby Krushers in preparation for an attack on Stronghold Fox, having learned of a planned rescue operation for the residents of Stronghold Fox _(from what would be the Baltic Sea)_ from a mole just outside the Stronghold.

Don goes on the expedition to Perksons Power Plant to ensure the hidden Krushers for the attack aren't discovered, and to kill Frederick who had recently taken note of Don's strange behaviours, with the arrival of SST 1 being his cue to start the attack.

_11:47_
Removed a short exchange between Ruiz and Cale about Krushers potentially being in the observation area, since Ruiz now checks the area for Krushers beforehand.

I also indicated that the alternative route into Thurein was thought up of beforehand.

_8/20/2025 10:59_
Removed certain details at the start of the Highway scene that suggests Ruiz didn't think ahead about how to proceed into Thurein, and removed a mention of slopes being able to significantly slow down Krushers since it no longer fitted in or made sense with how the scene goes, and it can be subtly indicated with how Krushers move paired with their large rectangular bodies.

_15:00_
I'm working on the Highway, Thurein, Store, Encounter, and Apartment scenes until 18:00, or if I reach the transition into the Power Shortage scene.

I plan to have Everett's death, Ruiz and Frank mourning, and the departure of the 19th expedition occur before the Highway scene, but I want to have a completed chunk of the episode so I can continue working on the drafts for the rest of the episode.

_15:21_
Removed the 'translation' done on the highway signs since I wasn't sure of how I could edit it in, and I also simplified the start of the Highway scene, and moved some of the descriptions around to when they'd be relevant.

_16:46_
While removing some of the old dialogue that no longer matches with the scene, I kept the detail of Krushers Barriers being simplified from their official name to be universal rather than something Ruiz does, considering I forgot about it myself.

_~16:50~_
Removed the detail of the highway Krusher Barriers being a repurposed form of traffic control meant to slow down drivers, not just because it wouldn't come up, but I realised it didn't really make much sense (documented at 17:01)

_17:44 - 17:59_
I forgot about the detail, but I decided to explain Ruiz going to check the highway exit for Krushers himself as being a time constraint due to the approaching sunset, so Kyle won't use his drone to survey Thurein since Ruiz will be under the impression that the town has gone untouched by Krushers, so keeping the recently arrived Krusher hidden from the view will be more believable.

Ruiz will mention the time constraint during the Apartment scene, and for the Store scene, it'll be a pitstop Nathan and Cale make to grab snacks as the rest of SST 1 goes on ahead to search for an apartment building, with Ruiz giving Nathan a two-way radio so that they can stay in contact.

Along the way to the apartment, Cale unexpectedly encounters a Krusher in a narrow street it just barely fits in, with Nathan being forced to try and quickly lure the Krusher away as a storm slowly approaches Thurein from the south.

_8/21/2025 10:22_
Decided to go more with how the Store scene originally went, only this time it's the rest of SST 1 besides Ruiz quickly grabbing snacks, with Ruiz only giving them 5 minutes so it stays with the idea of the time constraint, and Ruiz would be under the impression that there's no Krushers in Thurein so he would realistically be less cautious, something that would then lead into the Encounter scene.

_13:11_
Removed a background detail of SST 1 spotting 2 distant Krushers before the Highway scene, since I felt the Ruiz's dialogue was more natural and less confusing if it was omitted.

I later changed this to occur in Chinelo as SST 1 was leaving.

_17:05_
I've finished revising the scene entry for the Highway scene.

There's some strange dialogue but that's the point of a first draft (for the dialogue)

_8/24/2025 8:48_
As I started working on the 18th expedition scenes, I removed the question of how Krushers were managing to breach the frontlines because of how early in the episode that question would've came up, before viewers even knew what Krushers are.

_9:10_
Removed the detail of the original drone camera not having the feature to zoom in or out, because it didn't make sense that the drone being segmented would prevent the camera from having that feature.

_10:09_
I decided to work on the storyboards for the Highway scene, which is out of place in my storyboard book because I realised later on that there needed to be a buildup to it, when we'd be introduced to Krushers, so that the scene could help explain how Krushers function.

Anyhow, I realised just now that overhanging highway signs are at most just barely tall enough to avoid being clipped by a Wall Krusher, but Gears, which was what tore apart the highway barriers, could easily hit it, so I'll emphasis that detail instead.

_13:14_
Removed old details about Thurein that didn't match the idea of it being untouched by Krushers.

_8/28/2025 8:46_
Removed detail about a nearby river during the 18th expedition when Kyle looks around and spots signs of what was the New Frontlines, since it wouldn't have been shown in the episode so I cut it for time.

_9/07/2025 12:01_
This is more so an overall story change, but before the Fall of Chinelo, the Exclusion Zone would've gone generally unchanged from when the spread of Krushers was first contained in mid 2050, besides for some comparatively minor breaches that happened by chance.

As for a motive, rather than just having the frontlines collapse right after Rossgivo's 1000th year anniversary purely out of spite, the Spirit Remnants would've been so disconnected from their roots of Spiritual Connections due to the abuse their ancestors suffered from the Other People, that they would take years after the arrival of Krushers to properly understand them again.

_9/11/2025 17:07_
Cut out most of the episode's overall summary, because it went off on a tangent that made it feel like the first paragraph was in bold text for whatever reason.

_9/21/2025 13:47_
I've decided to try and put together a proper full draft for episode 1 today, since I haven't done much work on the story lately but I have ideas for the later episodes.

I've changed what would've been destroyed concrete road barriers to instead be sandbags, since they'd be much easier to transport and make more sense to use, which I originally explained as the road barriers having already been nearby, but I felt that detail would be harder to explain though plainly removing the road barriers would've taken away too much from the blockade feeling.

_14:45_
Slightly exaggerated how much Dave's drone was used by making its battery a bit more depleted.

_10/04/2025 11:18_
Considering my ideas for this episode still aren't concrete, I'll outline the act structure and organize the drafts I currently have.

_11:56_
The Unnerving Feeling scene felt too out of place and interrupted the pacing, so I've removed it, but it'll be properly mentioned in Survival 301.

_10/05/2025 12:49_
Removed a mention from Ruiz about the power still operating during the opening, since it can be subtly indicated instead, and its placement might make it forgettable, but John can casually explain it later on anyway.

_10/12/2025 09:45_
Decided to work on the rest of the episode before the opening, since it'd be clearly difficult to make a proper first draft if I constantly struggle with how to set the tone for the rest of the series during the opening.

_10/13/2025 11:11_
Decided to have SST 1 pass through an old abandoned 1000 year anniversary festival for Rossgivo, since it can casually explain what Rossgivo is, and help pinpoint a general date for the apocalypse, until there's a reason for the characters to better explain what happened later on.

_11:58_
Moved the Store scene to the opening.

_15:41_
I've cut out this scene because it lost the leadup that would've came from the Store scene, and I felt that the information it'd provide could instead be presented more casually.

_SCENE: Calendar_
   We learn a bit about Ruiz and Cale on how they were both in the military, that they're apparently quite young, but mostly Ruiz's knowledge and experience with Krushers to the point he deduces the city they're in, Thurein, was evacuated before the Krushers reached it; Largely because of the apparently _"minimal damage"_ the Krushers caused to the city, which we saw outside the store, compared to _"Chinelo"_.
   
   
   Cale enters the staffroom holding up a flashlight clearly intending to use it, but puts it back in his belt after realising the room has skylights, which although don't provide much sunlight since the Sun is already setting, gives the room enough visibility for Cale to look around.
  
   As Cale slides off his hiking backpack and drops it down near a table, an old employee schedule Calendar next to the backdoor, dated _January 2065_ catches his attention.
  
   Cale walks over and inspects the Calendar more closely: It was last marked off on _January 1, 2065_ (Thursday) and 3 different employees used it to keep track of their schedules by marking them using different coloured pens to differentiate between themselves _(and varied handwriting for their names at the top in the same colour, to show who corresponded to which colour.)_
  
   Cale chuckles to himself and says, _"5 years, it's been that long?"_, indicating it to be the date of which the society had fallen.
   
   Cale, out of habit from his time in SST 3 _(led by Gavis who's much more laidback than Ruiz)_, calls Ruiz over to check out the Calendar, but quickly realises there was no reason to do so since the Calendar isn't valuable to them as pointed later out by Ruiz, who told Cale to look for a storage room to see if there were additional supplies not stocked on the shelfs out front.
   
   Cale opts to explain himself to Ruiz, who by now is standing in the staffroom doorway, having passed the lantern he was holding over to someone else. Because Cale didn't specify what he wanted Ruiz to "check out", Ruiz asks him about it in a rather casual manner, but Cale stammers over his words as he tries to piece together a convincing explanation for why he called Ruiz over to see an old Calendar that really isn't all that special.
   
   Cale plays it off as having briefly forgotten that he was looking for a storage room, which Ruiz then directly asks Cale about on if he's found one, and Cale tells him that he hasn't.
   
   Ruiz, who now walked over to Cale, takes the chance to look in a nearby room, and also tell Cale to use his boxcutters when opening any boxes in the storage room _(which Ruiz happens to find himself in that moment causing him to stop mid-sentence in surprise, so he quickly repeats the first half of his sentence to make sure it's clear)_, instead of his pocket knife to avoid dulling its blades, then starts walking back to the front of the store.
   
   But as Ruiz is leaving, he realises the date the Calendar was last marked off (Thursday) indicates nobody came into work at the store on Friday, even though 3 employees who marked their shifts down on the Calendar using different coloured pens _(which had faded over the years and was now only faintly visible)_, would've all had work on Friday.
   
   At best, going off the store's opening hours that was listed near the entrance _(Ruiz hadn't paid much attention to it, but he could recall the opening and closing hours listed for each day since they were in especially large font)_, the store barely had 2 hours to open if one of the employees were to update the Calendar at the earliest from when the Krushers first reached the northern outskirts of Chinelo that day at 07:15.
   
   -Exclusion Zone Boundaries force Thurein to be cleared of civilians once Krushers reach the south end of Chinelo (less of an evacuation, but makes more sense to happen in a few hours)
   
   -Store opening is delayed till noon because of the nation's 1000 year anniversary (believable, and gives more time for Krushers to advance and push the military back, but Ruiz doesn't pay much attention to the opening hours, but it could be an overlay onto the sign) (not sure how or why Ruiz would bring it up, or if it'd feel less likely than just nobody updating the Calendar right away)
   
   -Cale provides some information during the fall of Chinelo from his perspective, providing some relevant info that sets a specific timeframe
   
   -The Calendar is from 2064, but the shifts are in the last week of that year which crosses into January ("5 years" from Cale might be a bit confusing at first, though this could also be the old Calendar that's been put aside, but helps to show that someone regularly marks off the days)
   
   
   Ruiz, after some pondering, figures the city they're in, Thurein, was evacuated before _"the Krushers"_ reached it due to the _minimal structural damage_ Krushers caused compared to Chinelo.
   
   When Cale asks about how Ruiz got to that conclusion, Ruiz points out that structural damage caused by Krushers is typically only collateral damage, and is almost never intentional _(A detail that's apparently quite obvious since they both knew about it for years, but we don't know what it means just yet.)_
   
   
   
   _**Cale**_
   "..Oh" _(notices the staffroom's skylights, which despite the already setting Sun, let just enough sunlight through for Cale to look around, so he puts down the large lantern he intended to use on a nearby table, and takes off his hiking backpacks and sets it down underneath the table - An old employee schedule Calendar catches his attention, and he walks over to it to inspect it more closely)_
   
   "5 years, it's really been that long? Hey Ruiz! Come check this out!"
   
   _(gradual look of realisation)_
   
   "..Wait, it's not-"
   
   _Camera suddenly snaps to a different position, with Ruiz now standing in the doorway behind Cale._
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   "What is it?"
   
   **_Cale_**
   _(Snaps his head around to face Ruiz)_ "Uh... I.. um, wanted to point out this Calendar, but you said to look for supplies.."
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   "Yes, and did you find anything?"
   
   **_Cale_**
   "No.. I'm so used to Gavis, I sometimes forget to take these expeditions more seriously.. Heck, I'm even older than you! And yet, it feels like you're my superior officer!"
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   "To be fair, _I am the squad leader_, and we're essentially in uncharted territory right now, but I wouldn't consider age a factor if most of what's left of our division, some of whom have actually been deployed in warfare, are too cowardly to even leave the stronghold.
   
   _Someone had to organize these expeditions_, and I figured the people on those expeditions should know how to deal with Krushers.
   
   I'd honestly put Gavis in charge considering _he actually fought against Krushers_ when they first appeared 20 years ago, but he's too old to be doing something so physically demanding, regardless of if he's the squad leader or not. That's why I settled for second best."
   
   _(Stretches his arm forward and pats Cale's shoulder)_
   
   "..Anyway, try looking for that storage room. It should be around here-" _(looks in the first room he sees, the one next to the backdoor, which happens to be the storage room)_ 
   
   "..Actually, _it is_ right here. Cale, you've got boxcutters, right?* Try not to dull the blades on your pocket knife, there's a lot of boxes back there."
   
   **_Cale_**
   _(Walks over to his hiking backpack, pulls it out from under the table, and ruffles through it, pulling out a boxcutter)_ "Yeah, I've got some right here."
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   "Alright then." _(Begins walking out of the staffroom)_
   
   "Mm?..." _(stops and glances back, then walks back over to more closely look at the Calendar)_
   
   "..Well, that explains the minimal damage in this city."
   
   
   **_Cale_**
   "Huh? Where'd you get that from? The Calendar?"
   
   _Ruiz refers to "Chinelo", which for all we know is a city with some importance as it's a basis for Ruiz's explanation to Cale (which itself provides us a bit of insight into what "Krushers" are.)
   
   **_Ruiz_**
   "Mostly that, but other details too. To be clear, this city must've been evacuated before the Krushers got here, that's why there isn't _nearly as much_ structural damage compared to Chinelo; It's usually collateral damage, since buildings are _obviously_ rarely targeted by Krushers."
   
   _(we wouldn't know why buildings normally aren't damaged intentionally by Krushers, but indicates there's certain criteria required for it to happen, which is answered in a later scene.)_
   
   _Ruiz mentions car alarms agitating Krushers, having seen it occur first-hand, so he isn't randomly bringing it up, but he does treats it as an uncommon cause to a Krusher's agitation, unsure if Cale was aware of such occurrences beforehand._
   
   "From the looks of it, most of this city's structural damage were Krushers tossing vehicles around, probably because car alarms - which are _bound_ to go off - trigger flashing lights that can agitate Krushers for whatever reason."
   
   _A wide panning aerial shot of the wreckage of cars outside lets us note how they're forcibly shoved onto the sidewalks, resembling nothing like a large-sCale accident, as well as how many there are._
   
   "And the streets must've been clogged with vehicles too; Not even Chinelo has as many cars on one street, only the highways do. Then again, we're near the outskirts of the city, it could just be backed up here."
   
   _Ruiz's last comment tells us roughly where they are, and helps line up with later scenes when Ruiz spots a radio tower on distant hills from a hotel near the store._
   
   "But the real kicker is _how long the Krushers would've taken to get here_. It took them 6 hours just to reach Chinelo, even with its surrounding farmlands and open fields. With how unconventional their movement is, a small bump or pit could easily slow them down, or even stop them.
   
   This city would've been twice as far as Chinelo, and the area between them is more urban. Add on the fact that the Krushers were constantly distracted while in Chinelo, and they likely didn't reach this place until the evening or well into the night.
   
   That's more than enough time for an evacuation, even if it didn't begin until Chinelo started getting overwhelmed, which I'm pretty sure was part of the protocol.
   
   But anyway Cale, go look through that storage room. I went off on a pretty long tangent there, so I should probably check back on the others.."
   
   **_Cale_**
   "Actually I.." _(moment of hesitation)_ "Never mind.."
   
   _(Cale stares at the Calendar, and says to himself)_ "If those frontlines really are nearby, why hasn't the military done anything to help us?"
   
   _We hear distant, muffled cracks of thunder. Ruiz steps out of the store to investigate, and he spots dark storm clouds moving in from the southwest, so he tells the rest of SST 1 that they need to find a place to settle down for the night quickly to avoid getting caught in the approaching storm._

_10/14/2025 17:06_
Made the standard street in the opening scene narrower by removing what would've been parking space for abandoned cars, since that detail can be brought up later in a more noticeable manner, while also helping to establish the feeling of claustrophobic streets.

_10/21/2025 17:38_
I've drafted out an initial outline but it had a runtime of 82 minutes, just based on my own ideas for how long it might take each scene to properly play out, so I've cut out certain scenes or decided to condense their details into other scenes.

Runtime is still just over an hour, so maybe I'll split the episode into two parts.

_10/24/2025 11:00 - 12:05_
Drafted how the festival scene should go.

I plan on readding a scene between Ruiz and Everett when they get a strange feeling from the bedroom of a teenaged boy in the store's upper apartment, which had been almost frozen in time, that leads to accidently revealing that his father _hadn't died before Ruiz was born_, but Ruiz explains to Everett that his father was one of the first military personnel to die to a Krusher, which he felt would've been too much of a depressing detail for him to mention.

Everett comforts Ruiz, assuring him that how his father died was a personal manner that he isn't required to share.

This is so Everett has some form of a character for when he dies soon after, while helping to develop Ruiz's character early on so it doesn't feel like a red haring.

_15:01 - 15:35_
Rewrote much of the Store scene which originally took place during the 19th expedition, into a proper broad draft for the opening.

The Storage Room bit at the end of the scene which originally led into the scrapped Calendar scene still makes reasonable sense to occur, it just lead into the discovery of the staircase leading to the upper apartment instead.
