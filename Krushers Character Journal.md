# Stronghold Fox Survivors

### Ruiz Kurnell
  24 year old Caucasian man with a slender, slightly muscular body, short brown hair, who was born on February 1st, 2046.
  
  _Ruiz's Arm Blades_: 6 rows of interlocking blades, on a large leather base that covers and slightly wraps around the right forearm - each row tied together by two strips of white rope from inside the leather base which pass through small holes in the ends of each row in a stitch-like manner - for the rows that retract _away from the handle_ (every other row), the ropes wrap back around at the other end of the leather base before being passed through those rows, with the only obvious sign being their slightly offset holes from the other rows to keep the ropes from getting tangled.
  
  The ropes are tied to a small handle in the wrist strap through a small 'bump' in the strap, which retracts or detracts the blades when it's pulled or pushed back, by forcing the blades into vertical positions through tension created at the other end of the ropes _(between the 1st and 2nd rows)_ which is almost immediately stopped at the 2nd row and pulls it up into a vertical position along with the other rows, or let them fall back down by returning the excess rope to its other end, removing the tension that kept them in vertical positions.
  
  Ruiz was in _Division 40 of the Rossgivo Military_ as part of a mortar squad, which he saw get killed by a single Wall Krusher during the Fall of Chinelo, which Ruiz narrowly avoided by chance while trying to haul over a nearby crate of munitions.
  
  Ruiz managed to save Trey's life by killing the Wall Krusher that had pinned him to the ground using a spare mortar, and brought the attention of nearby Field Medics over to Trey, who freed Trey by amputating his pinned left arm _(as it was already beyond saving.)_
  
  
  
  
  Ruiz had proposed the idea of SSTs in Stronghold Fox, and was the Squad Leader of SST 1.
  
  
  
  During Episode 1, Ruiz, along with SST 1, went out on a 5 day long expedition from March 1-5, 2070, discovering the first sign of new frontlines about 55km south of Chinelo, which laid in ruins, and after breaking into a radio station only to pick up dead silence across all signals, they realized that the nation of Rossgivo had likely been overrun by Krushers.
  
  Ruiz passed these findings onto Gavis - A former Tank Gunner in Division 12, who fought against the first Krushers 20 years prior, in 2050 - As Ruiz saw Gavis as having more seniority than him, even though Gavis often joked about it as being in age, rather than experience in combating Krushers.
  
  
  
  They found markings left by Slammers and Gears breaching the frontlines for Wall Krushers to pass through, but because nobody in Stronghold Fox knew about other variants, they theorized about what the Krushers could've done to cause them, _if it was even caused by Krushers_.
  
  
  Ruiz was part of a Mortar squad in Division 40 of the Rossgivian Military, _which he joined to follow in the footsteps of his dead father_, Louis, who died in February 2050 in the first conflicts against Krushers, when Ruiz had just turned 4 years old.
  
  Ruiz passed basic training in March 2065 at the age of 19, and was deployed to the frontlines in near Chinelo in April 2065.
   Due to a loophole for the _GCO Exclusion Zone_, "_**Any, and all Civilian residences, and/or non-vital Civilian infrastructure, located within 20km of active frontlines, must be cleared out, with further Civilian access forbidden unless reevaluated by higher military command.**_" Because the city-centre of Chinelo was just over 21km away from the frontlines, only its northern outskirts were impacted though a couple exceptions were made for places intersecting with the boundary if it was considered to be unnecessary problematic.
  
  When the frontlines came close to Chinelo in 2062, _most residents chose to stay_, and although a large number of businesses pulled out of the city, causing its economy to stagnate, its main source of income, _its farming industry_, was considered _vital infrastructure_ and left mostly untouched - with only a small number of farmers having to give up northern farmlands _within 12km of the frontlines, where Civilian Presence was outright forbidden_.
  
  The Rossgivo Military chose to use these "restricted areas" for:
  * Housing Personnel
  * Production of Rations
  * Manufacturing Military Supplies
  * Moving Personnel and Supplies (Chinelo's Rail Network)
  * Trench Networks (Trenches within Chinelo were built by survivors after the city fell)
  
  
  Ruiz typically wears a bladed weapon/tool strapped to his right arm that he calls _Koi Blades_ (Arm Blades) which he made himself - It's a set of retractable blades on a leather base, wrapped around the forearm and part of the upper arm, pointed outward to avoid accidental self-harm, and secured with two straps: One at the wrist, the other above the shoulder.
  
  The blades are controlled via a leather key inside the wrist strap, but Ruiz changes it to a loop of string while at the Sanctuary (_episode 7 onward_) making the blades easier to activate.
  * Leather Key: Pull out to activate, push back to deactivate
  * String: Pull to activate, pull again to deactivate
  There's 6 rows of 5 blades, with the blades of each row attached to a strip of leather at the base, and each strip is tied one of two strings underneath the main leather base.
  
  
  
  When Ruiz was thrown off the edge of Sanctuary by a Gear during episode 9, his body was caught in-between the Gear's 'teeth', and carried the momentum from its quick rotation along with it.
  
  _However, only Ruiz's left arm was crushed by the Gear_, but would recover in the following months, as the Gear's internal blood was spread out considerably for its movement, the weight of one of the Gear's 'teeth' was only on Ruiz's arm for less than a second, and there was heavy snowfall that night which Ruiz was pushed into and partially shielded him, _albeit still breaking his arm_.
  
  _Ruiz's left arm got lodged in-between the Gear's 'teeth', his torso was just grazed by it, and he made sure to bend his head away right before getting hit._
  
  When Ruiz was thrown off the edge of Sanctuary, most spectators thought he was good as dead, but Ruiz remembered the _Ice Pick Arrest_ Gavis had taught them during their accent to Sanctuary, so they wouldn't fall off the mountainside; _Ruiz figured his Koi Blades could do the same thing_.
  
  Because his left arm was seriously injured, Ruiz used his teeth to activate the blade, which the loop of string he replaced the leather key with had allowed him to do. Ruiz then dragged the blades through the snowdrift, slowing his descent enough for him to stop himself on some protruding rocks along the mountainside, about 10 metres down.
  
  Ruiz couldn't climb up on his own due to his injures, and required assistance from others to escape the now-ruined Sanctuary, and would remain on the sidelines until episode 14, when he fully recovered.



  The blades are made up of 6 rows of 5 sharp triangular metal, attached to a large piece of leather that wraps around the back and right side of his right forearm, so he doesn't accidently stab himself with it.
  
  Because of how the weapon was designed, the Blades can be forced to retracted if pushed inward from the side _during Part 1_, but Ruiz later fixes it _from Part 2 onward_. This allows Ruiz to use it to catch himself in a mountainside snowdrift in Episode 6, when he gets thrown off a ledge by a Gear (using his teeth to activate the weapon since the Gear broke his left arm, which doesn't fully recover until Episode 14 albeit it's a bit less responsive due to nerve damage, and it's only useable in Episode 11 because Ruiz uses rubber slings he made to make his arm easier to move.)
  
  Ruiz sacrifices himself in Episode 16 to save Nathan, and attempts to kill Don's Gear by slamming an Anti-Krusher shell into it at point-blank range, which tears the Gear apart but obliterates Ruiz's body killing him instantly, with only a portion of his Arm Blades being what was left of Ruiz.
  
  Don just barely managed to survive this, albeit having actually been killed but manages to return to the Physical World as Don tried to reconstruct his brain right before it was severely damaged by the explosion, which still got carried out though Don had to take a couple minutes to fully reconstruct the Gear as he barely had any BRK-D8 left over, though he gradually recovers it all.
  
  In order to keep Gabriel's awakened powers a secret, Ruiz was given credit for killing the Gear when the survivors were rescued by the New Rossgivo Military, which led to Ruiz being posthumously awarded the _Rossgivo Sword_ - a form of symbolism that itself was similar to how Ruiz died.

### Gavis Hovlow
  49 year old Caucasian man with a small beard, short side burns, and swept back light grey hair, who wears a white button up shirt underneath a brown vest, and dark blue jeans.
  
  Born on August 11, 2020.
  
  _Gavis is the reborn spirit of Dr. Torrik_, who died right as Gavis was conceived, and although Gavis has no memory of his past life, he still subconsciously retained a sense of guilt for his unethical human experimentation during the _Krusher Project_, leading to Gavis being the most willing and proactive in fighting against Krushers among the cast of characters.
  
  Despite the apocalyptic circumstances, he's quite humorous, caring to others, and with his wide knowledge of Krushers, he takes risks that may seem careless to those not familiar with him, but he does so in order to ease the nerves of others.
  
  Gavis still carries around his phone _(resembling an old iPhone model disregarding the significant time gap)_ in a yellow phone case, and its home screen is set to a photo of his Son and Daughter from their Highschool Graduation in 2060, wearing gowns as they hold up their diplomas.
  
  The main reason Gavis does this is because he downloaded a large amount of important survival information covering a wide range of topics a few years prior to the Fall of Chinelo, allowing him to access it offline, which he did after realising that people were typically dependent on libraries when the issue of survival knowledge came up in planning for hypothetical zombie apocalypses.
  
  Whenever he, or other people are in genuine danger, _Gavis immediately focuses on the situation on hand_, dropping any sort of humorous attitude he had, almost as if he transforms into a different person.
  
  Gavis served in the military to defend his country from GCOs as an act of patriotism in 2050, and had largely recovered from the [[PTSD]] he endured (_But not entirely, it still shows up when a Gear attacks Sanctuary, making Gavis recall his first encounter with a Wall Krusher, and the feeling of having to fight against a mysterious, unknown enemy._)
  
  As a result, Gavis became largely desensitized to Wall Krushers.
  
  Because Gavis worked as a Tank Gunner, he's one of the few people who has killed a Krusher, numbering 5 in total.
  
  Gavis was the one who proposed the concept of SSTs in Stronghold Fox, after it became apparent that the stronghold was hardly equipped to handle long-term survival which he felt that scavenging from the local area could make up for, and was willing to lead SST 1 as he himself had military experience against Krushers, though he had to persuade the other members from Division 40 to join since they were the ones supposed to protect the civilian population.
  
  Gavis served as the Leader of SST 1 for 2 years, until 2067 when he broke his leg during a scavenging run, and personally chose Ruiz to act as the Leader while he healed, though Ruiz's position later became permanent as per his request, while Gavis would become the Leader of the then newly formed SST 3.
  
  
  
  
  Afterwards, Gavis continued his career as an Engineer in Nicole, but became trapped in Stronghold Fox while visiting old childhood friends back in his hometown of Chinelo.
  
  Because Gavis mostly grew up prior to the arrival of Krushers, having already accomplished most of his major life goals, he's familiar with what would be normal life, whereas everyone else had considered Krushers as a new part of their lives.
  
  This made Gavis sympathetic towards younger folk who had their lives uprooted by Krushers.
  
  
  Gavis was born in August 2019, growing up in the city of Chinelo during his childhood, and being a smart young man, skipping a grade in high school and graduating from Nicole University with a _Degree in Engineering_ at the age of 20 in December 2039.
  
  Gavis then moved to Nicole where he started a family, having twins in 2042, a son and daughter.
  
  Gavis later took part in the first military operations against Krushers in 2050, before returning to his usual life in September later that year, but needed regular therapy sessions over the following years due to his PTSD he received during combat.
  
  Gavis, after his children went off to University, started Mountaineering in 2060 in Rossgivo's two southern and eastern mountain ranges _(which greatly helped during the trek up the mountain where the town of Sanctuary was located in Episode 7, having summited the same mountain several times before since it was a popular training spot for beginners)_, and later met Trey on a popular training mountain when one of the supervisors spoke in Roxian to help Trey with tightening his gear, since Trey (illegally) migrated from Roxia, and the usage of its language had caught Gavis's attention, which later led to Trey and Gavis becoming close friends.
  
  _On January 1, 2065_, Gavis, with his children now living on their own, went to Chinelo to meet up with Trey before they would embark on a mountaineering expedition, since transit to the larger cities were being overloaded because of the nation's _1000th year anniversary._ They ended up becoming stranded in Stronghold Fox barely a day after.
  
  This reason for them being in Chinelo at that time is brought up by Gavis after him and Trey reach Sanctuary in Episode 7, referring to their trek as completing their long overdue expedition. 
  
  
  While staying at Sanctuary, he made a mock version of a popular Rossgivian board game using scraps of paper and trinkets made out of cardboard, to uplift the mood of the young kids who were staying there.
  

### Kinn Shuapa
  27 year old Caucasian man, with short black hair, a slender body, and typically wears a blue _Nicole University_ branded jacket to serve as a reminder of his old normal life.
  
  Kinn graduated Nicole University with a _Degree in Engineering_ just 2 weeks prior to getting trapped in Stronghold Fox, having gone back to his hometown of Chinelo to "visit" _(stay with, until he could find a job)_ his parents for a couple weeks.
  
  Kinn keeps with him a 12 year old personal phone that he got for his 15th birthday, despite the complete collapse of cellular networks, as it stores plenty of photos and videos from his past life. _(Most of them are reminiscent of Old Roblox, especially the music videos.)_
  
  Kinn initially had no involvement with SSTs, but because of his knowledge in Engineering, he joined SST 6 to assist in a mission to restart a Nuclear Thorium Reactor that supplied most of Stronghold Fox's power, after it was damaged during a storm and automatically shutdown.
  
  In Episode 7, Kinn adds Mountaineering goggles to his appearance, and sweeps his hair down after growing it out while at the Sanctuary.
  
  Ken became Friends with Fredrick over the 5 years they were trapped in Stronghold Fox, mostly because they both had similar experiences, _having just graduated from University and Highschool respectively, and what would've been a new chapter of their lives getting torn away from them_.


### Trey Kelvin
  32 year old Caucasian man with bushy brown hair, a small beard, who's wearing a red checkerboard-pattern buttoned shirt, and a silver bead-like necklace with a small but noticeable container at the front.
  
  Trey was born in Roxia in August 2038, living with his mother until he immigrated to Rossgivo in 2056 _(albeit to attend University for the first 4 years)_, and was an avid, experienced mountaineer. Trey lost his left forearm during the Fall of Chinelo when he was pinned down by a Wall Krusher, he was freed by Ruiz but his left forearm was too severely injured and needed to be amputated - normally, the sheer weight of a Krusher would've completely crushed Trey's left forearm, a detail only Trey realised but he mistook it as the result of him having been thrown into the crumble zone of a ditched car's roof, meaning the Krusher wasn't resting entirely on his arm, and the fact his left forearm apparently lived through that _(somewhat)_ made Trey not question it further.
  
  Trey's birth name is Trey Cooper.
  
  Due to the nature of the amputation _(outside in a ditch by field medics)_, the nerves in Trey's left arm weren't properly preserved for him to use a practical prosthetic - though none were available in Stronghold Fox for Trey to use regardless.
  
  Trey can still move his left upper arm, which he calls his _"arm stub"_ as if he was born that way.
  
  Unbeknownst to Trey, he's a descendant of the Kuluho, which allowed him to inherit the Krushers' reconstruction powers after its body fluids accidently entered his bloodstream, during Trey's attempt to sacrifice himself in order to kill a Krusher by shoving an anti-Krusher shell into its eye at point-blank range, which blew off his right arm, however he subconsciously reconstructed it albeit freaking himself out before passing out from shock.
  
  Because of the Kuluho's spiritual presence that Krushers naturally avoid, Trey and Gabriel managed to survive three near-death experiences, completely unaware of why the Krushers would always avoid them.
  
  Trey didn't have a consistent place of residence, instead moving around every couple of months, working odd jobs to pay for living expenses, but also for mountaineering trips, though Trey planned to settle down by the age of 45.
  
  Trey knew Gavis ever since they met at a popular training mountain for beginning mountaineers, less than a month after Trey moved to Rossgivo, in the Summer of 2060 _(because it's safer during the summers - Gavis' children had also started living on their own, so Gavis wanted to try out mountaineering when he still had the time for it.)_
  
  Trey is bilingual, able to speak both Roxian and Rossgivian, Roxian being his first language since he grew up in Roxia. So whenever Trey talks to himself, it's in Roxian, but he talks in Rossgivian to other people. _(Roxian is really just English, so just normal voice acting)_
  
  
  
  
  Trey started a family in Stronghold Fox, but aside from pregnancies that were already ongoing, Trey and his wife Alice were the only people to do so _while inside Stronghold Fox_, something most of its residents actively avoided due to the circumstances.
  
  _Trey had a son named Gabriel_ on August 11th, 2066, but lost his wife _Alice_ at the start of 2070 to thyroid cancer, which couldn't be properly treated due to insufficient equipment, the lack of proper supplies, and qualified personnel within Stronghold Fox.
  
  Alice's body was cremated, and Trey, being grief-stricken, kept her ashes in a small metallic cylindrical container, which is apart of a necklace, and one that Trey almost always wears. Trey only takes it off either momentarily, or when he's bathing/showering to keep water from seeping in, even though the container is water-proof.
  
   The necklace serves as a connection to Alice for Trey, which gave Trey the spiritual connection needed to use the Power of Reconstruction, albeit mistaking it as regeneration powers, and never fully understood what it even was.
  
   But the fact it didn't regenerate Trey's left arm, along with the later reveal only use one power for regeneration, and to move their internal blood - the exact details intentionally kept vague - gives a hint to the Power of Reconstruction.



### Gabriel Kelvin
 Cheerful and innocent 3 year old boy with black hair, born and raised in Stronghold Fox, the Son of Trey and Alice Kelvin. Born on August 11th, 2066.
 
 He learned about spirituality from his parents, especially his dad Trey, which along with the necklace containing his mother's ashes _(a detail Gabriel didn't know about)_ that Trey wore, and was later passed onto Gabriel following Trey's death, gave him the spiritual connection necessary for him to become the _3rd Holder of Reconstruction_ - though he mistakes different applications of Reconstruction as an assortment of superpowers, and could only use it despite not knowing what it was at all because of the outrageous amount of spiritual energy Tally stored up in the previous 13.8 billion years _(some of which was used by the 2nd Holder, but they were able to partially control its usage properly, so their impact was miniscule)_ since he created that Physical World.
### Garrett Fletcher
  40 year old muscular Caucasian man with medium-length brown hair.
  
  Garrett loved exploring the Rossgivo wildlife, making him an experienced survivalist and scavenger, and was well known across Rossgivian social media platforms, but his lack of military experience kept him in SST 2, where he's second-in-command.
### Frederick
  23 year old Caucasian man with orange hair, faint freckles, who was part of a Highschool Basketball Team in Chinelo, from where he graduated before getting trapped in Stronghold Fox.
  
  Fredrick works at the SST HQ where he helps to file documentation, is quite athletic though mostly in terms of cardio from his Basketball experience, and has a friendship with Kinn whom he has romantic feelings for.
  
  Upon discovering Don's potentially suicidal behavior, possibly caused by Survivor's Guilt as he was apart of SST 4, who were all killed 2 years prior by a Krusher except for Don - when Don offers to go on the SST 6 expedition, so does Frederick in an effort to watch over Don, leading Kinn to do the same for Frederick.
  
  During the expedition as they're reaching the Western outskirts of Chinelo, Fredrick is killed by a Wall Krusher which slammed him into a streetlight, breaking his spine and making him scream in agony as his lungs filled with blood, before the Krusher then slammed Fredrick's body through a nearby storefront, killing him instantly.
  
  When SST 1 returns to Stronghold Fox from their 5 day long expedition later that night, after they discovered that the nation of Rossgivo had fallen, they also gather up Fredrick's remains in a garbage bag, later burying him in Stronghold Fox's cemetery.
### Don Joplin
  38 year old man of Kuluho descendent, with medium brown skin and messy brown hair, who wears a grey button up shirt and a slightly oversized brown coat, with a survival knife holster on the right side of his waist.
  
  Don worked as a surgeon after graduating Medical University, providing him with detailed anatomical knowledge, and would gain trust and respect from the Stronghold Fox residents, especially from Trey whose life he saved after Trey endured life-threatening injuries during the Fall of Chinelo.
  
  Don later became the Field Medic of SST 4 when it was formed in mid 2067.
  
  Don has BRK-D8 blood poisoning, from which he's able to use a portion of Reconstruction to manipulate his body, which he uses to revert bodily injuries unless other people are already aware of them, though he still reverts them slowly as if it was naturally healing.
  
  Don is the sole survivor of SST 4, believed to have been almost entirely killed by Krusher, but in reality Don killed most of them after he accidently caused the Krusher to stop in front of SST 4 due to his presence, which although couldn't logically be traced back to Don, he considered it too dangerous to let the SST 4 live as they had witnessed the Krusher's strange never-before documented behavior.
  
  
  
  
  
  A descendant of the Kuluho, who were kidnapped and experimented on by the Other People, led by Jeremy Torrik, in an attempt to learn more about the Kuluho's spiritual powers.
  
  Seeing the Other People as irredeemable and merciless, the Kuluho's descendants eventually escaped the secret facilities in Rossgivo where these experiments were conducted, and thus marked Rossgivo as their primary target.
  
  Since human experiments on the Kuluho started in 1965, their knowledge of spiritual powers had been lost to time, but by injecting themselves with stolen blood samples from Krusher specimens, they would gain control of a small portion of the Power of Reconstruction, which only allowed them to reconstruct any wounds to their bodies, which the Kuluho had mistook the power for.
  
  Don was one of many Kuluho used to sabotage Strongholds from within - in his case, Stronghold Fox - but he went to follow alongside Trey and Gabriel, who both had spiritual presences, a trait unique to the Kuluho, which they were both oblivious to.
  
  Upon reaching New Rossgivo, where Harold - another person unaware of their spiritual presence, but could clearly perceive the spiritual presences present in Krushers - is revealed to be able to detect Krushers, but had somehow activated for Trey and Gabriel. And Trey is revealed to have body healing abilities similar to Krushers - having some of a Krusher's body fluids enter his bloodstream - but couldn't heal his amputated left arm.
  
  In an attempt to keep the truth about Krushers and the Spiritual World secret, Don sniped Trey in the head amidst a battle caused by internal disputes within New Rossgivo to kill Trey - who Harold detected to be a Krusher, and also concealed Don's actions - and later killed Harold as the rest of the Stronghold Fox Survivors were leaving New Rossgivo.
  
  However, Don also had to kill another fellow survivor who learned of the fact that New Rossgivo didn't have any Sharpshooters that could've killed Trey, and happened to tell Don about it first, but the survivor's death would be uncovered, and raised internal suspicions among themselves.
  
  When Don reveals his true self and enhances his partial Power of Reconstruction to transform himself into a Gear, he uses Marcus's corpse who he killed earlier with an injection of BRK-D8, which he gathers to further enhance himself, as well to use Marcus's pair of eyes

### Marcus Devan
  46 year old strong athletic Millowian man with brown skin and short brown hair, whose the Leader of SST 2 as he's experienced with team coordination, can remain composed in stressful situations, and has great physical endurance, traits he gained while fighting for the resistance during the _Millow Civil War_ from 2042 to 2045.
  
  Marcus then worked in construction, which helped to maintain his physical strength along with him regularly going to the gym.
  
  Marcus fought for the resistance during the _Millow Civil War (2042-2045)_, where he gained valuable experience in close-quarters combat, and had 20 confirmed kills marked as tattoo tally marks along the left side of his torso, but in later years Marcus had a tattoo artist hide the marks and their meaning by incorporating them into a scaly coiling rattle snake tattoo - the tally marks are still visible from their thicker singular strokes, though Marcus plays them as messy linework.
  
  Marcus still feels guilty about the 20 lives he's taken, but doesn't tell anyone about what the rattle snake tattoo is truly for up until the perpetrations for the suspected battle at New Rossgivo, when he tells Gavis and SST 1 that he fought in the Millow Civil War and has first-hand experience in close-quarters combat, and reveals that the rattle snake tattoo was originally tally marks for each of the 20 people he had killed.
  
  Because of his guilt, Marcus becomes distressed if he comes across human remains _(albeit it'd be a reasonable response)_ and/or large spatters of blood, shown in Episode 4 when Marcus discovers the corpse of a survivor who was shot dead the previous night, giving him a panic attack.
### Cale Liner
  23 year old skinny Caucasian man with short light-blond hair, born in September 2046.
  
  Cale wanted to become an artist, but was rejected from Rossgivo's international art university after graduating High School, he instead worked as a freelancer to sustain himself until he was old enough to join the military, a decision Cale himself admits was questionable when he reflects back on it years later.
  
  During the Fall of Chinelo, Cale stayed back to assist in local evacuations.
  
  Unlike the rest of SST 1 who had Krusher Combat Training on top of their Basic Training, Cale was a Communications Operator in Division 40, taking on a support role in SST 1 originally fulfilled by Everett, mostly because Cale was willing to transfer into SST 1, and his low level of experience likely wouldn't make him helpful in any other roles.
  
  Cale was originally in SST 3, which took on less dangerous expeditions, and was led by Gavis who's much more laidback than Ruiz, however Gavis's experience as a frontline soldier during the 2050 operations made him accustomed to Krushers, and his leadership, expertise, and lack of cowardice had eventually influenced Cale enough for him to overcome his own fear of Krushers.
  
  Before the 19th expedition, Cale took Ruiz's offer of transferring over into SST 1, filling the spot of a fallen member, _Everett_, who was killed by a Krusher 2 days into the 18th expedition which forced SST 1 to return early - Cale went on a few scavenging trips as part of SST 1 before the 19th expedition, and is mostly familiar with the SST routes in Chinelo though largely from his time in SST 3.
### John Fodder
  35 year old Caucasian man with long messy black hair, who worked as the Plant Manager of Perksons Power Plant for about a year - a Nuclear Thorium Power Plant which was left online for 5 years, inadvertently giving Stronghold Fox a stable supply of power without human interaction because of the very low minimal operations it automatically adjusted to run at compared to its intended usage of servicing the local region.
  
  Due to his very specific education and work experience, he tends to work and stick to low-effort jobs in the Stronghold as his skills are extremely limited in potential usefulness - intentionally portraying John as a throwaway character who only serves to progress the plot more quickly.
  
  While taking guard of the Generator room in the basement of SST HQ on the night of March 1st, which John clearly doesn't take seriously as he dozed off soon after he started, even admitting that the only reason the job exists was because of an incident involving a drunk man, which installing a simple lock on the door could easily prevent, he's awoken by an alarm triggered by a power supply deficiency.
  
  Because of his essential knowledge regarding the power plant, he volunteers to go on the SST 6 expedition to aid in restarting the reactor units, particularly to account for unexpected variables that nobody else in the Stronghold would know how to work around.
  
  During the expedition, he wears his old white full-body uniform consisting of a jumpsuit and a safety helmet, since the uniforms were personalised to fit each employee—also revealing his full name from its nametag, _John Fodder_, making him seem even more like a throwaway character, which helps to divert attention away from Frederick whose being setup as a Main Character.
# Side Characters
### Harold Cooper
 36 year old Roxian Caucasian male born on January 1st, 2035, his birth name is Chris Cooper, the older brother of Trey Kelvin who ran away from home in December 2049 due to constant abuse from his dad, illegally immigrating to Rossgivo where he settled down even with the appearance of Krushers soon after.
 
 He reunites with his younger brother Trey at New Rossgivo
 
### Alice Kelvin
 Caucasian woman with long black hair who worked as a Physiotherapist in Chinelo, and had greatly aided in Trey Kelvin's recovery after he lost his left forearm during the Fall of Chinelo, who she later married and had a son, Gabriel, after Trey gained feelings for her afterwards.
 
 Alice died in January 2070 from Thyroid Cancer at the age of 33, which couldn't be treated properly due to Stronghold Fox's insufficient equipment, and the lack of supplies, as well as the low number of qualified medical personnel.
 
 Alice's maiden name is Summer.
### Martin
 A dark-skinned man, who had a wife in the 7th month pregnancy of their son, but they got separated in Chinelo amidst the chaos on January 2, 2065, with Martin ending up in Stronghold Fox, unaware of his wife and son's current whereabouts.
 
 Martin is a field medic in SST 3, and although he was trained as a Doctor, he gained experience working out in the field over the years.
 
 He always keeps with him a picture of his wife, and an ultrasound of their son, hoping to one day reunite with them. Martin would look back on these when he was accidently left behind on the mountainside below Sanctuary, before succumbing to his injuries.
 
 Martin's wife and his son are alive and well in Roxian Refugee Camp.
 
### Frank
  26 year old muscular Caucasian man with spiky reddish hair, who worked in the logistics department of Division 40 for 3 years prior to the Fall of Chinelo, having joined the military right after graduating High School. 
  
  He's the second-in-command of SST 1, since he's knowledgeable in planning and coordination, has great physical strength, and is experienced in hand-to-hand combat.
### Amy
  27 year old Caucasian woman with long straight brown hair, who worked as a field medic in Division 40, and eventually grew feelings for Nathan during her time in Stronghold Fox, which she would later confess to at the town of Sanctuary, beginning a relationship with Nathan.
  
  She wears a brown utility belt to store extra medical supplies and equipment.

# Town of Sanctuary
### Lisa
  29 year old Caucasian woman with long black hair, who had her son Seth while she was 17, who she had to raise on her own as Seth's father abandoned her when she revealed her pregnancy.
  
  She has high school level education in Nursing but chose not to pursue postsecondary education in order to raise Seth.
### Seth
  12 year old Caucasian boy with black hair, son of Lisa, who becomes a friend of Gabriel despite their 8 year age gap.
### Lincoln
  24 year old Roxian transgender male who had typically used testosterone to deepen his voice, and wore a binder to conceal their chest, but after the Fall of Rossgivo they became isolated in Sanctuary and so decided to forgo doing both because of their admittedly low importance.
  
  Around the time Lincoln began identifying himself as a male _(previously as a Lesbian female)_ he had travelled to Rossgivo before New Years to attend a prestigious University _(though he went to a public college in Roxia for his first semester due to Rossgivo's different school year)_, but following the Fall of Chinelo the school year was delayed as the frontlines had moved in close proximity to the University.
  
  But before a decision could be made, Lincoln got caught up in the Fall of Rossgivo...
### Harvey
  30 year old athletic Caucasian man who worked as a Police Officer for 5 years after High School before the frontlines fell, and assisted in the following emergency evacuations, but while on duty he was forced to flee, alongside a large number of civilians, to a small already mostly disserted town in a unique geological location that created a sort of moat around the town, which would eventually become Sanctuary, where Harvey remained isolated for the following 6 years.
  
  His skilled marksmanship and great physicality aids during the battle at New Rossgivo, where Harvey manages to take out 3 enemy fighters using a semi-automatic handgun,
  
  even when the fighters had far more powerful rifles but were too inexperienced to make full use of them, however Carter eventually gets seriously injured by gunfire, though survives thanks to the assistance of Amy.
  
  During the final episode, Harvey is killed by Don's Gear while attempting to temporarily blind it by shooting out its eyes, although Don hardly considered Harvey a target to go after, Harvey fled into a decaying building which partially collapsed on top of him after Don's Gear crashed into it in an attempt to scare him off.
# Secret Project
### Dr. Torrik
 34 year old 'British' Caucasian man, who was the original lead researcher of the project, which was swept under the rug and initially abandoned after the disaster in 1975, when a young Kuluho boy known as "_The Subject_", the 2nd Holder of Reconstruction, awakened to their powers without the need for a Spirit Necklace after discovering that their own people were being effectively tortured in human experiments, leading to them destroying most of the facility and setting all the Kuluho test subjects free, with Dr. Torrik being one of the few lucky survivors from The Subject's massacre.
 
 On his deathbed on November 11th, 2019, after having gone on to establish a successful scientific research corporation, Torrik told one of his young trusted employees, _Garry Helms_, about the secret government research project he's kept a secret for most of his life: Back in the 70s, it was discovered that people from a (formerly isolated) village deep in the 'Amazon' Rainforest could awaken supernatural abilities that defied the Laws of Physics after surviving a normally fatal injection of BRK-D8, which typically creates a large amount of blood clots almost immediately upon being injected into a person's bloodstream and kills them in about 2-10 minutes depending on the injection's concentration of BRK-D8, an outcome that was strangely entirely absent for the group of villagers despite them only having access to primitive technology.

### Dr. Helms
 73 year old Roxian man who had worked for Dr. Torrik under a civilian scientific research company from whom he had learned of the Project and where to locate additional information about it while Dr. Torrik was on his deathbed on November 11, 2019.
 
 Between 2020 and 2050, Dr. Helms would revive the Project and worked to uncover the exact nature of GCOs, particularly how they bended the Laws of Physics in ways that they couldn't yet explain.
 
 During this process, Dr. Helms uncovered how the power of Reconstruction worked, and that it worked similarly to sentience, both being linked to what's known as Dark Energy in order to function.
### The Subject
 The spirit of Tally (1st Holder of Reconstruction) originating from a different Physical World where Boy from the Kuluho takes place, who as a Holder, retains all his memories.
 
 Tally awakens after Gabriel is selected as the 3rd Holder of Reconstruction, which from his perspective was seemingly not long after he created the countless other Physical Worlds, or a "_multiverse_"...
