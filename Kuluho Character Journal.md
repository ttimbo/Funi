# Eon Escapees
### Jeremy "Henry" Torrik
 A 'British' 16 year old Caucasian male, a Causer of the Eventual baring the name of someone who was supposedly responsible for the existence of Krushers (in KRUSHERS), which Jeremy himself is aware of, so he plans the escape of Eon.

 Jeremy was born on January 1st, 1941. He was kidnapped on January 4rd, and arrived at Eon on January 18th, 1947.

 Due to the effects of the reengineered DNA replicated from the 8th Messenger's blood, it made him almost entirely forget about how he was kidnapped and taken at Eon. All Jeremy remembers was playing with toys in the yard of his childhood home, when a group of men grabbed Jeremy and forced him into the back of their tarped-over truck, which he had to use logical explanations for in order to piece together the memories he did have.

 "Fritz Torrik" is from Unknowable. He's similar to Jeremy but his mother was instead German rather than English which is why he has the first name "Fritz", and was born in 1940. Fritz wouldn't have ever caused the same events that led to the story of KRUSHERS as no governments discovered the Kuluho's spiritual powers, but Fritz and his parents were still killed in 1950 by an agent from STPR under orders to do so, out of paranoia that "Jeremy Torrik" would be born in the following years. 

### Tanalo "Anthony"
  7 year old boy from the Kuluho's village, he has light brown skin, curly brown hair, brown eyes, and was personally given a Spiritual Necklace by the Messenger - which has a distinct green marking - despite not receiving a spiritual power to be used alongside it.
  
  _Tanalo has Type 2 Diabetes_ though he was largely unaffected by it until he's brought to Eon in January 1957 where he's no longer under the watch of the Messenger, but it's discovered by the facility personnel shortly afterwards during his following months of isolation while he was building up his immune system, and so needs to be given regular Insulins doses.
  
  
  Tally was taken away to **Eon** in 1957, at 7 years old, and was given the name _"Anthony"._ His scarce knowledge of the outside world besides what the Messenger told him, and the lack of an etiquette immune system, meant it took him 2 full years before he was properly integrated into Eon, albeit with a limited vocabulary, and hardly any knowledge anything outside of Eon except for what was considered important.
 
  Near the end of the story, once the amnesiac created from the altered blood of the 8th Messenger is reverted, Tally speaks with the Creator. He learns how _(the phenomenon of Absolute Random)_ the Creator themselves was created, why they created the Physical World _(to replicate the joy of life)_ before receiving the Creator's power: **Power of Creation**.
 
  Tally is able to use two Spiritual Powers without splitting his spirit in half _(Which hasn't and never will happen, but theoretically, because spiritual powers were only meant to be used on their own and not multiple at once, two spiritual powers each take over half the instances of Absolute Random of a holder's spirit, which might kill the holder and prevent reincarnation forever upon ceasing the spiritual connection)_, since he's part of the 20th continuous generation that has been using them, granting him twice the resistance to the impacts of a spiritual power, essentially nullifying the potentially dangerous effects it could've had _(It's also why Tally could return to the Physical World after his entire body was blown apart, after reconstructing it with his then recently acquired Power of Reconstruction, with his spirit holding out long enough to avoid Reincarnation - The outcome of death for people who don't have spiritual connections like the Kuluho, though this doesn't mean it excludes the Kuluho, but they only need to be taught about it, so it limits such a thing to stillborn)_


**_Elva "Jane"_** is taken away in 1937 by human traffickers at 12 years old, which she escaped by using her newly acquired _Spiritual Power of Energy Manipulation_, but was captured by the government and was sent to **Eon**.

_**Elva "Kelsey"** (going by "Elva" later in the story)_ is born inside **Eon** in 1942, and was secretly taught about the Kuluho, spirituality, and their language by her mother _"Jane"_, who tells Kelsey that their real name is "**Elva**", which Kelsey eventually goes by later in the story.

Kelsey was separated from her mother at 5 years old in 1947, when the facility staff discovered that Jane had been secretly teaching Kelsey about the Kuluho.

Kelsey has light tan skin, shoulder-length brown hair, narrow blue eyes, a small nose, and wears her _mother's spiritual necklace_ which she recovered while escaping of Eon, and the green hat from a facility guard uniform that was used as a disguise, to help conceal her identity.
